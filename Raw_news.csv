Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said ex-FBI Director James Comey should be ""put behind bars"" for a post he made on Instagram on Thursday allegedly ""issuing a call to assassinate [President Donald Trump.]""
Earlier on Thursday, Comey shared a picture on Instagram with seashells formed in the numbers ""86 47."" To some, the number ""86"" is a call sign for murdering or getting rid of someone or something and ""47"" is typically used to refer to the 47th President of the United States.
""Cool shell formation on my beach walk…,"" Comey wrote in the caption of the picture, which has since been deleted.
Gabbard made the comments on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" Thursday night after Comey said he wasn't aware that the number ""86"" stands for some sort of violence.

""I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message,"" Comey said after deleting the initial picture. ""I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.""
Gabbard said Comey and his people ""need to be held to account according to the law"" regardless of why he said he posted the picture.
""The rule of law says people like him who issue direct threats against the POTUS, essentially issuing a call to assassinate him, must be held accountable under the law,"" Gabbard said, adding that she thinks he should be in jail.

The national intelligence director said Comey's post has her ""very concerned for [the president's life.]""
""I'm very concerned for the president's life; we've already seen assassination attempts. I'm very concerned for his life and James Comey, in my view, should be held accountable and put behind bars for this,"" she said.
'NEVER TRUMPER' COMEY'S '86 47' TRUMP POST UNDER INVESTIGATION
Gabbard also said Comey has a lot of influence and that there are ""people who take [him] very seriously.""
Shortly after Comey removed the post, Fox News Digital learned from a Secret Service source that the agency was aware of the incident and agents are being sent to investigate and interview Comey.
The White House also condemned Comey's actions, with White House deputy chief of staff and Cabinet Secretary Taylor Budowich calling his post ""deeply concerning.""
""While President Trump is currently on an international trip to the Middle East, the former FBI Director puts out what can clearly be interpreted as ‘a hit’ on the sitting President of the United States — a message etched in the sand,"" Budowich wrote on X. ""This is deeply concerning to all of us and is being taken seriously.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exclusive-nancy-mace-unloads-after-arrest-trans-activist-who-threatened-assassinate-her","EXCLUSIVE: Nancy Mace unloads after arrest of trans activist who allegedly threatened to 'assassinate' her","Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and Fatima Goss Graves, the CEO of the Women’s Law Center, square off during a DOGE hearing on protecting women’s sports.
""I hope they have makeup wipes in prison.""
That’s how Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., responded to the arrest of Samuel Theodore Cain, a trans-identifying activist who goes by ""Roxie Wolfe"" online, after he was charged with allegedly making repeated death threats against the congresswoman.
Cain, 19, was taken into custody by the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) after months of alleged threats, making him the first known trans activist in the country to be arrested for threatening a sitting member of Congress.
In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Mace didn’t hold back.
EXCLUSIVE: NANCY MACE TARGETED BY PENNSYLVANIA MAN ARRESTED FOR THREATENING TRUMP
Samuel Theodore Cain is pictured in a booking photo released by South Carolina law enforcement. Cain, a Greenville-area resident, was arrested for allegedly making death threats against U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. (Greenville County Sheriff's Office)
""I’ve waited for this for a long time,"" she said. ""Trans activists have been threatening to kill me every day for over six months, ever since I started filing bills to protect women’s spaces.""
Mace said her top priority has always been protecting her family, her staff and herself from the kind of politically motivated violence she believes is getting worse and is also ignored by the left.
""We live in fear every day, looking over our shoulders because these trans activists fuel violence,"" she said. ""And yet not one Democrat has spoken up to say it’s wrong.""
Cain allegedly posted violent messages online threatening to kill Mace and her children, describing graphic ways he would harm her. According to Mace, these threats were shared with law enforcement and the public for months.
Investigative journalist Andy Ngo reported Cain had a history of allegedly posting threats and expressing support for far-left causes.

In one post, Cain allegedly wrote, ""I'M GOING TO ASSASSINATE REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE WITH A GUN AND I'M BEING 100% DEAD ASS.""
Ngo's investigation revealed that Cain's social media accounts were filled with posts about trans-related topics and support for Democrats. After being contacted by the FBI about his posts, Cain allegedly admitted to making the threat but claimed he ""didn't mean it.""
""We’ve posted the voicemails,"" Mace said. ""We’ve shared the text messages. They talked about smashing my head into a bathroom floor or shooting me.
""This is who these people are. And still, not a single Democrat has stood up and said, ‘This is unacceptable.’""
Mace said the silence speaks volumes.
""When the left shows you who they are, believe them,"" she said. ""They are normalizing political violence, and they’re doing it by refusing to condemn it.""
Mace, who has introduced legislation to protect women’s bathrooms and spaces, said this arrest only proves why her efforts matter.
""This matters more than ever,"" she said. ""We have to protect women. Real men protect women. Real men don’t threaten them. But we can’t do this alone. We need more people to speak out.""
She said real change will only happen when people stop being afraid and start holding dangerous behavior accountable.
""This arrest happened because someone had the courage to act,"" she said. ""That was Capitol Police. That was SLED. I demanded it too, but they finally said, ‘Not one more.’ That’s what we need — courage, not silence.""

Cain allegedly made many of his threats publicly on social media. Mace said that’s a major problem and called for changes to Section 230, the law that shields tech platforms from liability. According to the DOJ, 230 ""provides immunity to online platforms from civil liability based on third-party content and for the removal of content in certain circumstances.""
""You can’t even sue blogs when people post threats or lies,"" she said. ""There’s no accountability. That has to change. People are being targeted, and these platforms are letting it happen.""
Some on the left have accused Mace of ""punching down"" for calling attention to her would-be attacker. Mace had a sharp response.
""Only Democrats blame the victim,"" she said. ""They don’t want to protect women. We’ve seen it in sports, bathrooms, locker rooms and now in politics. They always look the other way.
""There’s a total double standard. Not one Democrat colleague of mine has spoken out since the arrest. Not one.""
Asked what she would say to other lawmakers, especially women, who are scared to speak out on gender and safety issues, Mace was clear.
""Violence against women should always be taken seriously,"" she said. ""We should believe women. We should protect them. And we should prosecute the people who want to hurt them.

""If you care about women, prove it. Stand up and say, ‘No more!’""
Mace also revealed to Fox News Digital she’s preparing a victim impact statement and hopes to attend Cain’s bond hearing scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Friday.
""I’m working on it now,"" she said. ""We’re figuring out logistics, but I plan to be there.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/education-secretary-linda-mcmahon-dismisses-harvard-university-presidents-pay-cut-amid-antisemitism-probe","Education Secretary Linda McMahon dismisses Harvard University president's pay cut amid antisemitism probe","Education Secretary Linda McMahon discusses the administration’s dealings with Harvard University on ‘The Evening Edit.’
Education Secretary Linda McMahon questioned Harvard University President Alan Garber’s decision to take a 25% pay cut, saying she's not sure how that shows the university is changing policies on antisemitism or racial discrimination.
A Harvard University spokesperson told Fox News Wednesday Garber agreed to take a 25% reduction in pay for the 2025-26 school year after the Trump administration cut $2.2 billion in funding to the university.
McMahon was a guest on FOX Business’ ""The Evening Edit"" Thursday, and she opened up about the situation at the elite Ivy League institution and Garber’s reduction in pay.
""I'm not quite sure today with the president of Harvard, President Garber, taking a salary decrease is somehow a statement that they're changing their policies on antisemitism or racial discrimination. I don’t think that does a whole lot to solve the problem,"" McMahon told host Elizabeth MacDonald.
HARVARD UPDATES LAWSUIT AFTER TRUMP CANCELS ADDITIONAL $450M IN FUNDING
""And if you just look at some of the stats, I mean, the Harvard Crimson even reported that ... in their own research over the last couple of years, 2% to 3% of the faculty are conservative. And you just can't have that kind of discrepancy without having the theology or ideology be biased across campus.""

Harvard on Tuesday filed an update to its lawsuit against the Trump administration after another $450 million of research funding was cut.
The Massachusetts school amended the lawsuit hours after the federal government’s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced that eight federal agencies were terminating approximately $450 million in grants over what is described as Harvard’s ""radical"" and ""dark problem"" on campus.
""Harvard University has repeatedly failed to confront the pervasive race discrimination and antisemitic harassment plaguing its campus,"" the task force said in a statement.
The latest freeze comes in addition to $2.2 billion in funding already withheld and threats by the Trump administration to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status.

Harvard filed its initial lawsuit in April to block $2.2 billion in funding from being denied.
In its amended lawsuit, Harvard said much of the funding that was initially frozen has now been terminated, apparently with no hope of restoring it.
McMahon told MacDonald she did not think Harvard has changed its practices, adding the Trump administration has gone to the university to investigate.
""We wanted to sit down with President Garber. I spoke with him,"" McMahon said. ""We were going to sit down and discuss things, and we had sent a letter … and asked him to come to the table. And his answer was a lawsuit that Harvard filed.""
Since then, she said, there has been other communication with Garber, noting the Trump administration was doing some of the things without taking away the lawsuit.
But she added she is willing to discuss with Harvard officials what the university is doing differently.

McMahon acknowledged Harvard has tried to make changes, including asking the chair of the school’s Middle East Studies department to step down.
She made it clear, though, that the Trump administration is not taking anything off the table.
""It is clear antisemitism on campus is a civil rights violation, and Harvard has argued, as other elite universities have, that … maybe their First Amendment rights are being abridged,"" McMahon said. ""This is not about the First Amendment. This is civil rights.
""When you put other students at risk, their safety is of concern,"" she added. ""And their Jewish students will tell us that they’re even afraid to go to activities on campus. That’s clearly civil rights violations. Yes, that does bear investigation, and we’re not taking anything off the table.""
Harvard has become a target of Trump’s broader crackdown on universities, much of which is in response to last year’s anti-Israel unrest that erupted on campuses across the country.

On April 11, the Trump administration sent a letter to Garber and Harvard Corporation Lead Member Penny Pritzker outlining the institution’s failures and a list of demands from the White House. In the letter, the administration accused Harvard of failing to uphold civil rights laws and to foster an ""environment that produces intellectual creativity.""
The Trump administration threatened to pull federal funding if Harvard did not reform governance and leadership and its hiring and admissions practices by August 2025. The letter emphasized the need for Harvard to change its international admissions process to avoid admitting students who are ""hostile"" to American values or support terrorism or antisemitism.
Harvard refused to comply with the demands, and Garber said ""no government … should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.""

The Trump administration then froze $2.2 billion in funding to Harvard and is reportedly looking to slash another billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The university later filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its ""unlawful"" freezing of funds.

The Secret Service is investigating after ex-FBI Director James Comey posted an Instagram photo of seashells arranged to show the numbers ""86 47,"" a message White House officials swiftly condemned as an attempt to put out a ""hit"" against the 47th president.
Comey later deleted the post after online backlash from government officials, lawmakers and President Donald Trump’s son. Trump has faced two assassination attempts in the past year, one of which resulted in him being shot and a bystander being killed.
The post including the alleged ""hit"" showed the numbers in question etched into the sand at a beach using seashells. ""Cool shell formation on my beach walk…,"" Comey captioned the post Thursday.
While to some people the numbers may appear innocuous, ""86"" is frequently used as a call sign for murdering or getting rid of someone, while ""47"" has been interpreted as denoting the 47th president of the United States.

After backlash on social media over the post, including from at least one lawmaker who called for Comey to be arrested, the ex-FBI chief deleted the Instagram post and posted a message addressing it.
""I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message,"" the subsequent post from Comey said. ""I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.""
Shortly after Comey removed the post, Fox News Digital learned from a source in the Secret Service that the agency was aware of the matter and will be sending agents to investigate and interview Comey.

The FBI, where Comey used to work before he was fired by Trump during his first term, had no comment on the matter, but it was also apparent that people at the top levels of the agency were aware of the post.
Trump's new FBI director, Kash Patel, acknowledged on X that agency personnel were ""aware"" of Comey's post in his own statement shared on X.
""We are in communication with the Secret Service and Director Curran,"" Patel said. ""Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.""

The ex-FBI chief's social media slip-up hearkens back to an incident in February 2020 involving comedian and actor John Mulaney. During an opening monologue on Saturday Night Live, Mulaney made a joke referencing Trump and the assassination of Roman dictator Julius Ceasar, prompting an investigation by the FBI.
""Another thing that happened under Julius Caesar, he was such a powerful maniac that all the senators grabbed knives, and they stabbed him to death. That would be an interesting thing if we brought that back now,"" Mulaney said, in part, to laughter from the live SNL audience.
In response to Comey's post, the White House swiftly condemned Comey's actions, and White House deputy chief of staff and Cabinet Secretary Taylor Budowich called the move ""deeply concerning.""

Nancy Mace, R-S.C., details her resolution requiring staffers to use bathrooms corresponding with their biological sex on 'The Ingraham Angle.'
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has warned a high-end fitness club it must change its bathroom policy after a recent complaint or face prosecution under Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ""Let Kids Be Kids"" law protecting children from sexually explicit content and gender ideology.
""Men don’t belong in female restrooms and locker rooms. That’s not happening in Florida under my watch,"" Uthmeier told Fox News Digital Thursday after a complaint was issued by a woman who visited Life Time Fitness in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The woman said she encountered a person she identified as a biological male in the women’s locker room.
The woman, Sonja Horton, said she was in the sauna with a ""man in a bikini"" and that the front desk told her ""whatever you identify as, you can go wherever you want,"" according to WPTV.

""Life Time has a choice: immediately change your policy so that your female patrons can stay active, free from fear and with their privacy intact or, we’ll meet you in court,"" said Uthmeier.
""And that goes for any Florida gym. In this state, we don’t sacrifice women’s rights to satisfy men’s delusions.""
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier warned a high-end fitness club it must change its bathroom policy after a recent complaint or face prosecution.  (Getty)
Horton reported not feeling safe, adding it was not ""fair"" biological men could use the women’s room.
The incident report led Uthmeier to send a warning letter to Life Time Inc., saying its policies ""clearly harm and endanger women who use facilities at Life Time Palm Beach Gardens.""
It said the gym argued that Palm Beach County code makes gender identity a protected class and ""therefore condones or requires its harmful locker room policy.""
STAY IN YOUR LANE: FLA AG FIRES NEXT VOLLEY AGAINST JUDGE HALTING STATE IMMIGRATION LAW
""If that were true, the policy would nonetheless run afoul of Florida laws that safeguard the fundamental rights of women,"" Uthmeier wrote.
In response, a Life Time official told Fox News Digital it ""carefully reviewed"" Uthmeier’s warning letter and ""interpretation of the interplay between the Florida Civil Rights Act prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations based on ""sex,"" and the Palm Beach County ordinance, which additionally prohibits discrimination based on ""gender identity and expression.""
The Life Time official said Uthmeier’s legal opinion is that Florida law requires access to locker rooms based on sex listed on government documents, adding that the gym follows ""all applicable federal, state and local public accommodation laws within each jurisdiction it operates.""
""Accordingly, we will comply with Attorney General Uthmeier’s legal opinion while also remaining committed to welcoming all members at our Palm Beach Gardens club,"" the official said.

The State Department said nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran have been constructive, and President Donald Trump has been clear about wanting to see diplomacy.
U.S. State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott was asked during a press briefing Thursday about comments made by Trump, and he said the U.S. and Iran were close to an Iran nuclear deal.
Trump, speaking in Doha, Qatar, said he thinks the U.S. and Iran ""are getting close"" to making a deal without any violence. In Trump fashion, he said there are two steps — ""a very nice step and a violent step"" — which he added consists of violence people have never seen before.
The president also said Thursday in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), that the U.S. and Iran have ""sort of"" agreed to terms on a nuclear deal.
TRUMP SAYS IRAN MUST DITCH ‘CONCEPT OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON’ AHEAD OF MORE TALKS
State Department Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott told reporters nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran have been ""constructive"" and that President Trump wants to see diplomacy. (State Department)
""Iran has sort of agreed to the terms. They’re not going to make — I call it, in a friendly way — nuclear dust,"" Trump told reporters, suggesting a growing alignment with the terms he has been seeking. ""We’re not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.""
While Pigott would not comment on private diplomatic conversations or negotiations, he reiterated Trump’s stance on the matter.
""The president has been clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon,"" Pigott told reporters. ""The talks have been described as constructive by the participants in them, and so, again, Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. And the president has been clear. He wants diplomacy. He wants to see a diplomatic solution here.""
Pigott made his remarks as Trump tours the Middle East, making stops in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
TRUMP CALLS FOR 'NUCLEAR PEACE AGREEMENT' WITH IRAN RATHER THAN BLOWING COUNTRY 'TO SMITHEREENS'

Trump, while speaking at the Gulf Cooperation Council in Riyadh Wednesday, reiterated his desire to make a deal with Iran and called for building upon the progress of the Abraham Accords by adding more countries to the historic agreement.
Trump made the comments while addressing leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council as part of his four-day visit to the region.
TRUMP SAYS HE'LL BE 'LEADING THE PACK' TO WAR WITH IRAN IF DEAL PROSPECTS WHITHER AWAY
""I want to make a deal with Iran. I want to do something if possible. But for that to happen, it must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars and permanently and verifiably cease its pursuit of nuclear weapons. They cannot have a nuclear weapon,"" Trump said.
Though Trump said he wants to make a deal with Iran and see Tehran prosper, he also recently accused the Iranian regime of not only hurting its own nation, but the region at large.
""Iran's leaders have focused on stealing their people's wealth to fund terror and bloodshed abroad. Most tragic of all, they have dragged down an entire region with them,"" Trump said.
The president pointed to the ""countless lives lost"" in Iran’s effort to prop up the former Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, which collapsed in December, and accused its support of Hezbollah for the downfall of Beirut, which he said was ""once called the Paris of the Middle East.""

It is unclear how Trump’s negative comments toward Tehran could affect ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran.
Still, The Associated Press reported Thursday that a top political, military and nuclear advisor to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told NBC News Wednesday that Tehran stands ready to get rid of its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium that can be weaponized, agree to enrich uranium only to the lower levels needed for civilian use and allow international inspectors to supervise the process.
In return, Ali Shamkhani, the advisor, said Iran wants an immediate lifting of all economic sanctions.

Said ""launched his drone in support of the attack plan"" and told an undercover FBI agent in the lead-up to the foiled plot he recommended that ""everyone have about seven magazines because you don’t want to be in there and run out of ammo,"" according to officials.
Said is now facing charges of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and distributing information related to a destructive device. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years per count if convicted.

The Justice Department said that, in April, ""two undercover officers indicated they intended to carry out Said’s plan at the direction of ISIS.
""In response, Said provided material assistance to the attack plan, including providing armor-piercing ammunition and magazines for the attack, flying his drone over TACOM to conduct operational reconnaissance, training the undercover employees on firearms and the construction of Molotov cocktails for use during the attack and planning numerous details of the attack, including how to enter TACOM and which building to target.""

A criminal complaint stated that, around June 2024, Said started communicating with an undercover FBI agent who he thought was a fellow ISIS supporter.
The complaint noted that Said enlisted in the Michigan Army National Guard in September 2022 and attended basic training at Fort Moore in Georgia. He later reported to the Michigan Army National Guard Taylor Armory before being discharged around December 2024.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-rebel-mutiny-threatens-derail-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-before-key-committee-hurdle","GOP rebel mutiny threatens to derail Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' before key committee hurdle","Constitutional law attorney Andrew Cherkasky discusses the Supreme Court hearing over judicial power that could have major implications for the Trump administration on ‘America Reports.’
President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" appears to be in peril as of late Thursday afternoon, ahead of a critical meeting by the House Budget Committee to bring the legislation close to a House-wide vote.
At least three Republicans on the committee are expected to vote against advancing the bill, a multitrillion-dollar piece of legislation aimed at enacting Trump's priorities on tax, the border, immigration, defense, energy and raising the debt limit.
GOP Reps. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., both told Fox News Digital they would vote against the bill in committee in its current form.
Norman said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, also would vote against the bill. Roy himself signaled he was opposed to the legislation both on X and in comments to reporters.
ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION

""Right now, the House proposal fails to meet the moment. It does not meaningfully change spending (Medicaid expansion to able bodied, [Inflation Reduction Act] subsidies). Plus many of the decent provisions and cuts, don’t begin until 2029 and beyond. That is swamp accounting to dodge real savings,"" Roy wrote Thursday on X.
Other members of the committee also suggested they had concerns.
Rep. Josh Brecheen, R-Okla., told Fox News Digital he wanted the Friday morning meeting delayed.
And Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., a rank-and-file member who is not known for defying House Republican leaders, said the legislation did not seem ""sincere"" and would not reveal how he will vote.
With one expected absence for Republicans on the House Budget Committee, the GOP can only afford one ""no"" vote to still advance the legislation.
Once the bill is passed through the House Budget Committee, it must then come before the House Rules Committee — which sets terms for debating the bill House-wide — before it is weighed by all House lawmakers.
Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he wants the legislation to pass the House by Memorial Day.

""I think we're on schedule,"" Johnson told reporters leaving a conference-wide meeting on the bill Thursday afternoon.
He also said he was confident Budget Committee Republicans could advance the bill on Friday.
""I'm talking to everybody and I think we're gonna get this thing done on the schedule that we proposed,"" Johnson said in response to conservative concerns.
Both Norman and Roy have complained that the legislation's provisions aimed at curbing abuse of the Medicaid system and rolling back former President Joe Biden's green energy subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act did not go far enough.
Timing is among their key concerns on both fronts. Conservatives have issues with Medicaid work requirements not going into effect until 2029, the end of Trump's term. They also questioned what they saw as a delay in phasing out green energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act.
""I questioned the timing on work requirements, I questioned the IRS phase-outs. I didn't get an answer on that,"" Norman told reporters after the Thursday afternoon meeting. ""My point is, we need to have answers before it hits the floor.""
Clyde told Fox News Digital of his opposition, ""I’m a NO on advancing the budget reconciliation bill out of the Budget Committee in its current form.""
""I’m actively involved in negotiations to improve this package, and I’m hopeful that we will do so quickly in order to successfully deliver on President Trump’s agenda for the American people,"" he said.
Another issue at hand involves continued tensions over state and local tax (SALT) deductions, which primarily affect high cost-of-living states — and Republicans representing critical swing districts within blue states.
The Trump bill currently would raise the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 for single and married tax filers to $30,000 — a number that's not enough for a group of moderate House Republicans that's large enough to sink the final bill.
Conservative fiscal hawks have said higher SALT deduction caps must be paired with deeper spending cuts.

""SALT is a pay-for,"" Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who is not on the budget committee, said in response to conservatives asking for offsets.
Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said he would vote against the bill if SALT deduction caps were not sufficient.  (Tierney L. Cross)
He pointed out that SALT deduction caps would be eliminated entirely if Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which Republicans want to extend permanently via this bill, is allowed to expire.
""The fact is, if the tax bill expires, the cap on SALT expires, which means it goes back to unlimited. So any cap is a savings within the bill,"" Lawler said. ""So this idea that we need to find a pay-for, that's not an us problem. That's other people's problems.""
But Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., another SALT Caucus member, signaled he would be OK with moving up the deadline on Medicaid work requirements in exchange for raising the SALT deduction cap.
House GOP leaders are expected to continue negotiating with both groups, however.
Both Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said they expected the Budget Committee meeting to go on as planned.
House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, however, seemed less optimistic.
""We'll see,"" he said when asked about the Friday meeting, adding the likely ""no"" votes are ""potentially enough to delay it.""
Congressional Republicans are moving Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process.

By lowering the Senate's threshold for passage down to the House's own simple majority requirement, it allows the party in control of both chambers and the White House to pass vast pieces of legislation while entirely sidelining the minority — in this case, Democrats.
Eleven House committees have cobbled together individual portions of the bill, which will be put back into a framework that the House Budget Committee will consider Friday morning.
Then it must head to the Senate, which will likely amend the bill, which then must sync up with the House before arriving on Trump's desk for a signature.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/washington-state-bill-opens-housing-assistance-illegal-immigrants-critics-warn","Washington state bill opens housing assistance to illegal immigrants, critics warn","A proposed Washington state bill could extend housing and cash assistance to noncitizens, raising concerns that illegal immigrants may qualify, according to critics.
A bill recently passed by lawmakers in Washington state could open the door for illegal immigrants to receive cash assistance under a program designed to provide housing assistance and other essential items to certain low-income residents unable to work, critics say.
The state's Democratic-controlled Legislature last month passed SB 5232, which has been delivered to Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson.
The bill updates provisions related to the state's Housing and Essential Needs Referral Program (HEN), which provides assistance to low-income U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and victims of human trafficking if they can't work due to their physical or mental condition.

Lawmakers amended the bill to remove the eligibility requirement that recipients be ""citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise residing in the United States under color of law.""
""This year seems to be the year for noncitizens,"" Republican state Sen. Leonard Christian, a ranking member of the Senate Human Services Committee, told Fox News Digital. ""We have no problem giving direct money, housing money to noncitizens, along with $150 million in Medicaid for noncitizens.""
""It just seems like the state is trying really hard to pick a fight with the Trump administration,"" he added.
The state has set aside roughly $130 million for the HEN program in an effort to address homelessness and housing.
In a social media post, state Rep. Travis Couture also criticized SB 5232, calling it the ""same budget"" with ""more recipients.""
NEWSOM ASKS FOR NEARLY ANOTHER $3B FOR STATE HEALTH PROGRAM OVERWHELMED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
""That means our people get kicked out of line in favor of illegal immigrants,"" he wrote last week. ""Gov. Ferguson — veto this. It’s unfair and it’s wrong. Put our own people first!""
Ferguson hasn't signaled whether he will sign the legislation. Fox News Digital has reached out to the sponsors of the bill and the governor's office.

Christian characterized the government handing out funds for housing as a ""gift of taxpayer dollars,"" noting the money doesn't have many ""guardrails around it."" He cited his own life experience, recalling his mother once leaving him and his 12-year-old brother at home to go cross-country trucking.
""He used the money that was given to my mom to buy groceries and food for us kids, to buy marijuana and alcohol at the age of 12,"" he said. ""I saw first hand (the impact of) substance abuse and handing money to somebody.""
NEWSOM SIGNS $2.8B BAILOUT FOR HEALTHCARE PROGRAM OVERRUN BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
Statewide, Democrats have favored higher taxes on businesses and the rich, which ultimately trickle down to middle- and lower-class residents and programs that benefit illegal immigrants over American citizens, Christian said.
""A lot of times, the Democratic Party thinks more with their hearts than with their head,"" he said. ""It's the idea that they see a problem, and they think they can fix it.""
Republicans want to address the same issues but look at how potential solutions will affect the overall population, he said.

""They don't get the fact that somebody else has got to pay for that crazy program,"" he said. ""I would certainly like to go around with a card and have fun and save the world, but who's going to pay that Visa bill, and that's when they don't seem to care.""
SB 5232 was passed as the state faces a $16 billion budget shortfall. In addition, Ferguson recently signed a handful of bills to protect immigrants' rights, including measures to allow the state to inspect private detention centers and prohibit bail bond agents from enforcing immigration laws.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tim-kaines-attempt-force-salvadoran-report-human-rights-falls-flat","Tim Kaine's attempt to force Salvadoran report on human rights falls flat","Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., speak at a press conference announcing a privileged resolution that would require the Trump administration to report on its work with El Salvador on prisoner negotiations and funding.
A vote to force the Trump administration to produce a report on El Salvador’s human rights practices, spearheaded by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., failed by a roll call vote of 45-50 on Thursday.
Kaine, along with co-sponsors Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Alex Padilla of California, all Democrats, cited powers granted by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to put forward a privileged resolution – which required a vote regardless of GOP opposition – to compel the administration to provide such details.
Speaking to reporters when he announced the vote, Kaine said that if passed, it would freeze foreign assistance to the Salvadoran government if the Trump administration were to balk.
""I also send a message to the government of El Salvador,"" Kaine said during his remarks, breaking into Spanish midway.

""You might think it's cute right now to grab attention by a bromance with President Donald Trump. He's going to be a president for poco más (a short time) – tres años más (three more years).""
Continuing in Spanish, Kaine said the two countries will always have relations, before transitioning back to English to say that the U.S. will not soon forget ""you violating the human rights of American citizens – you're wrong.""
On the Senate floor Thursday, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said Senate Democrats are ""voting once again to defend illegal immigrant criminals. They seem to like to do that. It’s hard to believe, but it’s true.""
""They’re going to come to this floor today, and they’re going to line up to express their blind loyalty and belligerent support for illegal immigrant criminals,"" said Barrasso, who, as majority whip, is the second-most-senior Republican.
KAINE BREAKS INTO SPANISH AS DEMS FORCE VOTE TARGETING TRUMP-BUKELE ALLIANCE OVER DEPORTATIONS
""No Democrats are going to be able to answer the question – How does allowing MS-13 gang members to roam free in our communities make America safer?""
Kaine's office did provide a copy of the resolution. along with a statement from the Virginia Democrat:
""If President Trump is going to cut secret deals to send people to foreign prisons without due process, every Senator—and the public—needs to understand the details about those deportations, including the human rights record of the nation putting American residents behind bars,"" Kaine said.
""This information is critical at a time when the Trump Administration has admitted to wrongfully deporting people to El Salvador, and after Trump has said he’s also looking for ways to deport American citizens to the same terrible prisons. Today, we will force a vote on our legislation to put all Senators on record on requiring some accountability from this lawless Administration.""
Van Hollen, who took a junket to El Salvador to attempt to bring deported suspected gang member Kilmar Garcia to Maryland – where his family lives – said Trump has failed to comply with the order to facilitate his return.
""We will use this resolution to force accountability,"" said Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, a House supporter of the resolution, although Kaine said it does not require their blessing.

President Donald Trump weighed in on the birthright citizenship case being argued in front of the Supreme Court Thursday, insisting the law originally was intended to benefit the descendants of slaves, not illegal immigrants.
""Birthright Citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent Citizens of the United States of America, and bringing their families with them, all the time laughing at the ‘SUCKERS’ that we are!"" Trump wrote in a post Thursday morning on his Truth Social platform as the arguments were being heard. ""The United States of America is the only Country in the World that does this, for what reason, nobody knows – But the drug cartels love it!""
Trump added that birthright citizenship, which was adopted as a constitutional amendment in 1868, was primarily intended to benefit the babies of slaves.
SUPREME COURT TAKES ON BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP: JUSTICES APPEAR OPEN TO CONSERVING STATUS QUO

""It had nothing to do with Illegal Immigration for people wanting to SCAM our Country, from all parts of the World, which they have done for many years,"" Trump said in his post. ""It had to do with Civil War results, and the babies of slaves who our politicians felt, correctly, needed protection. Please explain this to the Supreme Court of the United States.""
Trump cited the birthright citizenship issue as ""yet another point that leads to the dysfunction of America.""
""We are, for the sake of being politically correct, a STUPID Country but, in actuality, this is the exact opposite of being politically correct, and it is yet another point that leads to the dysfunction of America.""

While the case being heard Thursday resulted from disputes against the president's effort to end birthright citizenship, which is the right for any child born in the U.S. to automatically acquire citizenship, the issue of whether it is permissible for lower courts to permanently block Trump's executive actions will hinge on the justices' decision.
Through universal injunctions, lower federal courts can bar authorities from enforcing a Trump executive order.
CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
The birthright citizenship case was set in motion after Trump signed a Day One executive order, meant to go into effect Feb. 19, reinterpreting the 19th-century amendment. But shortly after the order was signed, legal challenges ensued and Democratic-appointed federal judges began blocking the president's action.
Meanwhile, appeals of those decisions from the Trump administration failed before the Supreme Court decided to take up the case.
It is unclear when the high court's justices' final ruling on the birthright citizenship case will come out. It could take weeks, or it could take just several hours if they decide to issue an emergency ruling right away.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-trump-birthright-citizenship-order-injunctions","Supreme Court takes on birthright citizenship: Justices seemingly split on lower court powers","Fox News' David Spunt reports the latest on the case. Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley also weighs in during 'The Faulkner Focus,' and discusses the latest on backlash over a Wisconsin judge's arrest.
The Supreme Court struggled to reach consensus Thursday in oral arguments involving President Donald Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship, in a case that could more broadly call into question the powers of lower courts to block executive branch actions.
It’s unclear when the justices will rule, but their decision to fast-track the case means an opinion or order could come within weeks – or even days.
The focus in the courtroom ostensibly was the birthright citizenship executive order Trump signed on his first day back in office. But arguments largely focused on whether lower courts that issued universal injunctions blocking the order acted beyond the scope of their authority, as the Trump administration argued in its Supreme Court appeal earlier this year.
Justices across the ideological spectrum appeared to agree Thursday that the use of universal injunctions has surged in recent years under both Democratic and Republican presidents. But after more than two hours of oral arguments, they seemed split on how, exactly, to proceed.

""As far as I see it, this order violates four Supreme Court precedents,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor told U.S. Solicitor General D John Sauer, noting that blocking or limiting lower court injunctions could invite hundreds or thousands of new individual lawsuits.
Others on the court suggested that federal judges have been given too much runway to halt the orders of a sitting president.
""The practical problem is that there are 680 district court judges, and they are dedicated and they are scholarly,"" said Justice Samuel Alito.
""And I'm not impugning their motives in any way,"" he added. ""But, you know, sometimes they're wrong.""
Kelsi Corkran, representing private plaintiffs and advocacy groups, proposed a middle-ground approach: allowing universal injunctions when government actions violate fundamental constitutional rights.
If lower courts do get ""ahead of their skis,"" she said, appeals courts can still rein them in, just as they do now.
No easy solution to resolve the thorny legal problem presented itself, and justices grappled with a litany of related procedural questions in debating whether to scale back nationwide injunctions – and if so, what legal standards should be applied.

U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer used the bulk of his opening arguments Thursday to reiterate the government's view that universal injunctions exceeded lower courts’ Article III powers under the Constitution, noting that the injunctions ""transgress the traditional bounds of equitable authority,"" and ""create a host of practical problems.""
Universal injunctions ""require judges to make rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions,"" he said. ""They operate asymmetrically, forcing the government to win everywhere,"" and ""invert,"" in the administration’s view, the ordinary hierarchical hierarchy of appellate review. ""They create the ongoing risk of conflicting judgments.""
During a five-minute rebuttal period, Justice Sotomayor questioned Sauer on what authorities the courts, under their argument, would have in this scenario.
""Your theory here is arguing that Article III and principles of equity [clause] both prohibit federal courts from issuing universal injunctions to have your argument,"" she said, adding: ""If that's true, that means even the Supreme Court doesn't have that power.""
Justice Elena Kagan, meanwhile, pointed out the practical challenge of expecting the Supreme Court to weigh in on every issue now handled by lower courts, which have already faced hundreds of federal lawsuits during Trump’s second term.
Kagan also noted to Sauer that the Trump administration has lost every federal lawsuit challenging the birthright citizenship executive order, including under judges Trump appointed during his first term.
""This is not a hypothetical; this is happening out there,"" she told him. ""Every court is ruling against you.""
""If I were in your shoes there’s no way I’d approach the Supreme Court in this case,"" said Kagan, who in fact had previously served in Sauer’s exact role as U.S. solicitor general.

As expected, several conservative justices on the court criticized the universal injunctions.
Justice Clarence Thomas, who in 2018 described their use as ""legally and historically dubious,"" noted Thursday that it was not until 1963 that the first universal injunctions were used, appearing to agree with the government's assertion that they could survive without them.
But Justice Alito, for his part, appeared split. He asked Sauer about the possibilities of plaintiffs seeking emergency class certification, and de facto nationwide relief via other avenues, to highlight the point that blocking universal injunctions would not resolve the practical problems raised by the government.
And if that’s the case, he said, ""then what is the point of this argument about universal injunctions?""
New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum, representing the states, acknowledged that there could be alternative remedies for federal courts other than nationwide injunctions – though he suggested that in certain cases, the class action alternative presented by the Trump administration may not move fast enough to grant relief in certain cases.
""We are sympathetic to some of the concerns the United States has about percolation, about running the table in particular cases,"" he said. ""We just don't think that that supports a bright line rule that says they're never available.""
He suggested they should be available in certain cases, including the one currently before the court on birthright citizenship – a case where the ""alternative ways of remedying the harm for the parties are not practically or legally workable.""
Roberts and Sotomayor questioned Feigenbaum more in depth on how to determine in what cases universal injunction should not be the preferred remedy and how to ensure district courts are following that.
Justices on the high court agreed in April to hear the case, which centers on three lower courts that issued national injunctions earlier this year blocking Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. The order reinterprets the 14th Amendment to deny automatic U.S. citizenship to children born in the U.S. if their mother is unlawfully present or temporarily in the country, and if their father is neither a U.S. citizen nor a lawful permanent resident at time of birth. Trump's action remains on hold nationwide pending Supreme Court intervention.

President Donald Trump also weighed in on the case directly in a post Thursday on Truth Social. ""Birthright Citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent Citizens of the United States of America,"" he said, arguing that the law is about the ""babies of slaves"" and has nothing to do with illegal immigration.
As it turned out, the oral arguments had very little to do with the merits of the birthright citizenship challenge and focused instead on nationwide injunctions.

A Supreme Court decision here could have sweeping national implications, setting a precedent that would affect the more than 310 federal lawsuits that have challenged White House actions since Trump's second presidency began on Jan. 20, 2025, according to a Fox News data analysis.
The consolidated cases before the court are Trump v. CASA, Trump v. the State of Washington, and Trump v. New Jersey.

Summer Lee, D-Pa., reintroduced a resolution Thursday that, if passed, could give federal dollars to the descendants of enslaved people brought from Africa to the United States.
A member of the House of Representatives' progressive ""Squad"" is reviving legislation aimed at giving reparations payments to Black Americans for slavery.
Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., reintroduced a resolution Thursday that, if passed, could give federal dollars to the descendants of enslaved people brought from Africa to the United States.
Former Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., who lost her 2024 primary to a more moderate Democrat, introduced the reparations bill in the last Congress. Bush's bill, unveiled in May 2023, called for $14 trillion to be put toward reparations payments for descendants of slavery in the United States, but it did not go anywhere.
""We say to the rest of America: If you are truly committed to justice, as you try to say you are, you cannot look away. You cannot turn your back on the demand for reparations, because until there is repair, there will be no justice. And where there is no justice, we will continue to fight. We’re not going anywhere. We are awake. We are organized, and we will win. Reparations now,"" Bush said alongside progressive Democrat Reps. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., at Lee's announcement.

HOUSE DEMS REINTRODUCE REPARATIONS LEGISLATION: 'WE REFUSE TO BE SILENT'
""Trump’s policies are nothing but anti-Blackness on steroids,"" Pressley said Thursday before adding, ""This America wants to make America Jim Crow again, and then some.""
""Reparations are a necessary step towards true equity in our country, and a more just future. There is an opportunity for Congress to confront our nation’s racist history of slavery and White supremacy. We must provide the descendants of enslaved Black families with the reparations they were promised,"" Tlaib added.
It's an effort mounted by progressive Democrats every year, but one that has little chance of passing.
That's especially true for the 119th Congress, which is controlled by Republicans while President Donald Trump is also in the White House.

One longtime GOP lawmaker, House Science Committee Chair Brian Babin, R-Texas, even introduced legislation earlier this year to pull federal funding from state and local jurisdictions that enacted reparations policies.
""We know there will be pushback,"" Lee said Thursday, adding, ""Reparations are a proposal to level the playing field, but the only way we could ever have a level playing field is by remedying the harms that have been done by the system.""
But Lee signaled on Wednesday that the long odds would not deter her.
""When we think about the debt that is owed through our country . . . the Trump administration and the Republican Party talks a lot about paying our debts. This is one of them,"" Lee told Fox News.

""They were not theoretical, but they were harms from government policies and practices and laws. There were real laws that were on the book that caused systemic disadvantages. They created systemic advantages for other people. So you can never have equal footing until you remedy that,"" Lee said.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-poll-numbers-toilet-james-carville-says-were-winning-elections","Dems' poll numbers are in the toilet, but veteran strategist James Carville says 'we're winning elections'","Veteran Democratic Party strategist James Carville warned Democrats that they need to ditch jargon that confuses or even offends persuadable voters.
Despite a flurry of polling so far this year indicating the Democratic Party's favorability sinking to record lows, veteran Democrat strategist and pundit James Carville remains optimistic, as he points to recent ballot box victories by his party.
""You can't discount people winning elections,"" Carville told Fox News Digital on Thursday.
Carville spoke the day after a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was the latest to spell trouble for the Democratic Party, six months after they suffered setbacks up and down the ballot at the hands of now-President Donald Trump and Republicans.
The Democratic Party has been in the political wilderness since last November's elections, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. And Republicans made gains among Black and Hispanic voters as well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base.
ON THE RISE; NEW POLL INDICATES TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATINGS EDGING UP

The latest public opinion polls indicate the Democratic Party sinking to new favorability lows. (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser)
According to the survey, only about one-third of Democrats are very or somewhat optimistic about the future of the Democratic Party. That's a steep decline from last July, when around six in 10 Democrats said they were optimistic. The survey, conducted May 1-5, points to an increase in optimism among Republicans, with 55% more optimistic about the future of the GOP, up from 47% last summer.
HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING
Since Trump's return to power earlier this year, an increasingly energized base of Democrats is urging party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration. And their anger is directed not only at Republicans, but also at Democrats they feel aren't vocal enough in their opposition to Trump.
And that's fueled the plunge in the Democratic Party's favorable ratings, which have hit historic lows in several recent surveys.
The Democrats' ratings stood underwater in the most recent Fox News national poll at 41% favorable and 56% unfavorable in a survey conducted April 18-21.
(Fox News )
That's an all-time low for the Democrats in Fox News polling. And for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower than that of the GOP, which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable.
The figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys.
The Democratic Party's favorable ratings were well in negative territory in a Pew Research national survey – 38% favorable, 60% unfavorable – conducted in early April and at 36% favorable, 60% unfavorable in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field a couple of weeks earlier.
And national polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University and in March by CNN and by NBC News also indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows.
Confidence in the Democratic Party's congressional leadership sunk to an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll conducted early last month.
The confidence rating for Democrats' leadership in Congress stood at 25% in the survey, which was nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023.
And the semi-annual Harvard Youth Poll, which was released late last month, indicated that approval ratings for Democrats in Congress among Americans aged 18-29 nosedived.
""I don’t doubt any of that’s true,"" Carville told Fox News. ""But there’s one thing: We’re winning elections left and right as we’re talking about how the Democratic number or image is low.""

John Ewing, Jr., a Democrat, this week ousted a longtime Republican mayor in Omaha, Nebraska, a blue dot in a reliably red state. Ewing will become Omaha's first Black mayor.
Last month, the Democrat-aligned candidate comfortably defeated the Republican-aligned candidate in a Wisconsin state Supreme Court election. The high-profile and expensive campaign grabbed plenty of national attention and outside money.
Democrats have also performed very well so far this year in special elections, including flipping red state Senate seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania.

In addition to looking back, Carville also pointed ahead to November's gubernatorial election in Virginia, where Democrats hope to win back the governor's office in Richmond.
""Let's see what's going to happen in Virginia,"" said Carville, who first grabbed national attention for his work as a lead strategist on former President Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign.
And Carville predicted that ""we’re going to win that.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/social-media-giant-hit-scathing-ad-campaign-amid-anger-ai-chatbots-sexually-exploiting-kids","Social media giant hit with scathing ad campaign amid anger over AI chatbots sexually exploiting kids","‘The Robby Starbuck Show’ host Robby Starbuck discusses his defamation lawsuit against Meta on ‘The Will Cain Show.’
A nonprofit parents coalition is calling on multiple congressional committees to launch an investigation into Meta for prioritizing engagement metrics that put children's safety at risk.
The call is part of a three-pronged attack campaign by the American Parents Coalition (APC), launched Thursday. It includes a letter to lawmakers with calls for investigations, a new parental notification system to help parents stay informed on issues impacting their kids at Meta and beyond, and mobile billboards at Meta D.C. and California headquarters, calling out the company for failure to adequately prioritize protecting children.
APC's campaign follows an April Wall Street Journal report that included an investigation looking into how the company's metrics focus has led to potential harms for children.

""This is not the first time Meta has been caught making tech available to kids that exposes them to inappropriate content,"" APC Executive Director Alleigh Marre said. ""Parents across America should be extremely wary of their children’s online activity, especially when it involves emerging technology like AI digital companions. This pattern of bad behavior from Meta shows they cannot be trusted to self-correct, and we are urging Congress to take meaningful action in holding Meta accountable for not prioritizing child safety.""

The April Wall Street Journal investigation not only reported on internal concerns that Meta was skirting ethical lines to make its AI chatbot system more advanced, but also shared how the report's authors tested out the system themselves.
The reporters' test conversations found that Meta's AI chatbot systems engaged and sometimes escalated sexual discussions – even when the chatbot knew the user was underage. The investigation found that the AI chatbot could also be programmed to simulate a minor's persona while engaging with the end-user in a sexually explicit conversation.
In some instances, the test conversations were able to get Meta's chatbot to speak about romantic encounters in the voice of Disney movie characters.

""The reporting referenced in this letter doesn’t reflect how people actually experience these AIs, which for teens is often in valuable ways, like helping with homework and learning new skills,"" a Meta spokesperson told Fox News Digital in response to the campaign. ""We recognize parents’ concerns about these new technologies, which is why we've put additional age-appropriate guardrails in place that allow parents to see if their teens have been chatting with AIs, and to place time limits on our apps. Importantly, we don't allow AIs to present as under 18s and we prohibit sexually explicit conversations with teens.""
Per the Journal's reporting, which Meta contests, the company made multiple internal decisions to loosen guardrails around its chatbots to make them as engaging as possible. Meta reportedly made an exemption to allow ""explicit"" content within its chatbot as long as it is in the content of romantic role playing.
At the same time, Meta has taken steps to help improve its product safety for minor users, such as the introduction of Instagram's ""Teen Accounts"" with built-in safety protections that came out in 2024 amid increased scrutiny over the company's AI.
In April, Meta announced the expansion of these accounts to Facebook and Messenger. On these accounts, minors are prohibited from conversations about sexually explicit content with chatbots.

Meta also has parental supervision tools built into its AI chatbot system that are supposed to show parents whom their kids are talking to on a regular basis, including chatbot, and has tools to shut down accounts exhibiting potential suspicious behavior tied to child sexual exploitation.
Coinciding with APC's campaign attacking Meta, the group launched a new website titled ""DangersofMeta.com"" with links to APC's letter to members of Congress, images of the mobile billboards they are deploying, a link to the new ""lookout"" notification system, and recent articles about Meta's work pertaining to children's safety.

Harvard University on Tuesday filed an update to its lawsuit against the Trump administration after another $450 million of research funding was cut.
The Ivy League school amended the lawsuit hours after the federal government’s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced that eight federal agencies were terminating approximately $450 million in grants over what is described as Harvard’s ""radical"" and ""dark problem"" on campus.
""Harvard University has repeatedly failed to confront the pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment plaguing its campus,"" the task force said in a statement.
The latest freeze comes in addition to the already frozen $2.2 billion in funding to the university and threats by the Trump administration to revoke its tax-exempt status.
HARVARD PRESIDENT CLAIMS ‘UNFOUNDED RETALIATION’ AMID TRUMP FUNDING FEUD

Harvard filed the initial lawsuit in April to block the initial $2.2 billion freeze.
In its amended lawsuit, Harvard said much of the funding that was initially frozen has now been terminated, apparently with no hope of restoring it.
A May 6 letter from the National Institute of Health notified Harvard that grants were being cut over allegations of campus antisemitism. It said grants are typically suspended pending an opportunity to take corrective action, but ""no corrective action is possible here,"" according to the lawsuit.

Harvard later received similar letters from the Defense Department, Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture and other agencies, according to the suit. It's seeking to have those cuts overturned.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-military-might-would-unleashed-enemy-drones-homeland-bipartisan-bill-passes","US military would be unleashed on enemy drones on the homeland if bipartisan bill passes","Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on the Pentagon's warning about a drone risk on 'Special Report.'
FIRST ON FOX: Dozens of drones that traipsed over Langley Air Force base in late 2023 revealed an astonishing oversight: Military officials did not believe they had the authority to shoot down the unmanned vehicles over the U.S. homeland.
A new bipartisan bill, known as the COUNTER Act, seeks to rectify that, offering more bases the opportunity to become a ""covered facility,"" or one that has the authority to shoot down drones that encroach on their airspace.
The new bill has broad bipartisan and bicameral support, giving it a greater chance of becoming law. It’s led by Armed Services Committee members Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., in the Senate, and companion legislation is being introduced by August Pfluger, R-Texas, and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., in the House.
Currently, only half of the 360 domestic U.S. bases are considered ""covered facilities"" that are allowed to engage with unidentified drones. The legislation expands the narrow definition of a covered facility under current statute to allow all military facilities that have a well-defined perimeter to apply for approval that allows them to engage with drones.
PENTAGON LACKS COUNTER-DRONE PROCEDURE LEADING TO INCURSIONS LIKE AT LANGLEY, EXPERTS SAY
Legislation led by Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., in the Senate would expand domestic military base authority to shoot drones down. (Reuters)
The legislation also stipulates that the secretary of defense delegate authority to combatant commanders to engage drone attacks, cutting down on time to get approval through the chain of command in emergency situations.
""Leaving American military facilities vulnerable to drone incursions puts our service members, the general public and our national security at risk,"" Cotton said.
For more than two weeks in December 2023, a swarm of mystery drones flew into restricted airspace over Langley, home to key national security facilities and the F-22 Raptor stealth fighters.
Lack of a standard protocol for such incursions left Langley officials unsure of what to do, other than allow the 20-foot-long drones to hover near their classified facilities.
To this day, the Pentagon has said little about the incidents, other than to confirm that they occurred. Whether it knows where the drones came from or what they were doing is unclear.
""As commercial drones become more commonplace, we must ensure that they are not being used to share sensitive information with our adversaries, to conduct attacks against our service members, or otherwise pose a threat to our national security,"" Gillibrand said.
PLANES, STARS AND HOBBYISTS: LAWMAKERS INSIST NOTHING ‘NEFARIOUS’ IS HAPPENING IN NJ SKIES

As defense-minded lawmakers sought more answers, Langley officials referred them to the FBI, who referred them to Northern Command, who referred them to local law enforcement, a congressional source told Fox News Digital last year.
Gen. Gregory Guillot, chief of Northern Command (NORCOM) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said in February that there were over 350 unauthorized drone detections over military bases last year.
""The primary threat I see for them in the way they’ve been operating is detection and perhaps surveillance of sensitive capabilities on our installations,"" he said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. ""There were 350 detections reported last year on military installations, and that was 350 over a total of 100 different installations of all types and levels of security.""
A surge in mysterious drone activity over New Jersey late last year and early this year prompted mass confusion.
Guillot said that regulations on UAV countermeasures created ""significant vulnerabilities that have been exploited by known and unknown actors.""

He advocated for what the new legislation would do: expand Section 130i of Title 10, which pertains to the protection of  ""certain facilities and assets from unmanned aircraft.""
""I would propose and advocate for expansion of 130i [authorities] to include all military installations, not just covered installations,"" Guillot said during the hearing. ""I’d also like to see the range expanded to slightly beyond the installation, so they don’t have to wait for the threat to get over the installation before they can address it, because many of these systems can use side looking or slant range, and so they could … surveil the base from outside the perimeter. And under the current authorities, we can’t address that.""

Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts reined in Justice Sonia Sotomayor during argument over birthright citizenship and nationwide court injunctions on Thursday.
Sotomayor dominated questioning for several minutes at the outset of Thursday's argument after taking over from Justice Clarence Thomas. She pressed U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer for President Donald Trump's administration on several points relating to the authority for federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, often speaking over the lawyer and interrupting him.
Sotomayor argued that Trump's order invalidating birthright citizenship violated four Supreme Court precedents, and that it was justified for a federal judge to grant an injunction against such a controversial order.
""You are claiming that not just the Supreme Court, that both the Supreme Court and no lower court, can stop an executive from universally violating holdings by this court,"" Sotomayor said.

""We are not claiming that because we're conceding that there could be an appropriate case only in class only,"" Sauer said.
""But I hear that--,"" Sotomayor said, beginning to interrupt Sauer.
""Can I hear the rest of his answer?"" Roberts then interjected.

Sauer then elaborated on his statement, saying the government is arguing that federal courts can intervene on behalf of specific plaintiffs before them, but not nationwide. He said the Supreme Court has the authority to grant nationwide injunctions in certain circumstances.

Sauer used the bulk of his opening arguments Thursday to reiterate the Trump administration's view that universal injunctions exceeded lower courts’ Article III powers under the Constitution, noting that the injunctions ""transgress the traditional bounds of equitable authority,"" and ""create a host of practical problems.""
Universal injunctions ""require judges to make rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions,"" he said. ""They operate asymmetrically, forcing the government to win everywhere,"" and ""invert,"" in the administration’s view, the ordinary hierarchical hierarchy of appellate review. They create the ongoing risk of conflicting judgments.""

A Supreme Court decision here could have sweeping national implications, setting a precedent that would affect the more than 310 federal lawsuits that have challenged White House actions since Trump's second presidency began on Jan. 20, 2025, according to a Fox News data analysis.

The consolidated cases before the court are Trump v. CASA, Trump v. the State of Washington, and Trump v. New Jersey.
It’s unclear when the justices will rule, but their decision to fast-track the case means an opinion or order could come within weeks – or even days.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-dems-open-investigation-trumps-acceptance-400-million-jet-from-qatar","House Dems open investigation into Trump's acceptance of $400 million jet from Qatar","People from Knoxville, Tennessee; Houston; and Detroit deliberate Qatar's 'free' $400M luxury plane gift.
FIRST ON FOX: House Democrats are opening an investigation into President Donald Trump and his administration's acceptance of a $400 million private jet from the Qatari government.
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, led his fellow Democrats on the panel in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House counsel David Warrington on Thursday.
They're specifically asking Bondi to hand over a reported legal memo she wrote that is meant to assert the legality of Trump accepting the plane on behalf of the U.S.
""Any legal memo purporting to make such a claim would obviously fly in the face of the text of the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause, which explicitly prohibits the President from accepting any ‘present [or] Emolument... of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State’ unless he has ‘the Consent of Congress,'"" the letter reads.

""Accordingly, we are writing to request that you provide the Committee on the Judiciary with these memos immediately as their analysis and conclusions are apparently the basis for the President’s decision to disregard the plain text of the Constitution.""
Raskin and the other Judiciary Committee Democrats went so far as to accuse Trump or people in his orbit of soliciting a bribe from Qatar.
""President Trump’s statements expressing displeasure with delays in the delivery of his new Boeing aircraft to serve as Air Force One and the timing of this ‘gift’ suggest that President Trump or a member of his Administration may have improperly solicited this 'nice gesture' from the Qatari government,"" the Democrats said, citing Trump's own comments.
""The fact that, according to President Trump, the plane would not remain in service to the United States but would rather be donated to his presidential library after his term concludes further raises the possibility that this ‘nice gesture’ is intended as a bribe to Donald Trump.""
Multiple outlets reported that Bondi and Warrington drafted a legal memo that said it was ""legally permissible"" for Trump to accept the plane and then have it transferred to his presidential library when he leaves office.
A source familiar with the discussions told Fox News Digital the memo was drafted by the Office of Legal Counsel and signed by Bondi.
But Democrats suggested the memo was likely not sufficient grounds for Trump to bypass Congress on the issue, and pointed out Bondi herself had previously lobbied on Qatar's behalf.

""The Constitution is clear: Congress — not the Attorney General or the White House Counsel — has the exclusive authority to approve or reject a gift 'of any kind whatever' given to the President by a foreign government,"" the letter said.
""We would also note that, even if the Attorney General had a constitutional role to play here, Attorney General Bondi has a significant and obvious conflict of interest given her prior registration as an official agent of the Qatari government and earned no less than $115,000 per month lobbying on its behalf.""
When reached for comment on the matter, a source close to Bondi said only that the letter was received by the Department of Justice (DOJ).
In addition to looking for the memo itself, the Democratic letter also asked for any communications and other records regarding the Boeing plane's transfer, and discussions of the gift's legal justifications.
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have little power to compel Trump administration officials to comply, given their status as the minority party in the chamber.
But Raskin has been scrutinizing Trump and his inner circle over family foreign ties since the former president’s first term.
The latest letter comes during Trump's diplomatic visit to the Middle East, where Qatar was one of his stops.
Trump has defended his acceptance of the plane on multiple occasions, arguing he would be a ""stupid person"" to not take it, while bashing Democrats for their criticism.
""So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane. Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social this week.

Senate Republicans said they knew little when asked by Fox News Digital earlier this week.
Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., skirted the issue during his most recent weekly press conference.
""I'm not following all the twists and turns of the charter jet. My understanding is it's not a personal gift for the president of the United States, and other nations give us gifts all the time, but, I'm going to leave it to the administration. They know much more about the details,"" Johnson told reporters.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
In a move that adds to an ever-growing stack of court interventions that have stymied the president's second-term agenda, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from targeting foreign service workers' collective bargaining rights amid an ongoing challenge against an executive order.
The American Foreign Service Association, a labor union for foreign service workers, lodged a legal challenge after President Donald Trump issued an executive order earlier this year that, according to a White House fact sheet, aimed to ""end collective bargaining with Federal unions in"" various government entities ""with national security missions.""
""Certain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s agenda,"" the release asserted. ""Protecting America’s national security is a core constitutional duty, and President Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his efforts to protect Americans and our national interests.""
Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia — who was nominated by then-President Bill Clinton decades ago — issued the order granting the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.

The order signed by Friedman states, in part, that Trump's executive order ""is unlawful as applied to the Defendants who are heads of agencies with employees represented by the Plaintiff.""
""The effect of the Executive Order was substantial: it removed collective bargaining rights from approximately two-thirds of the federal workforce,"" Friedman's opinion declared, echoing verbatim a sentence included in an opinion Friedman issued last month in a similar case.
In that case, which was brought by the National Treasury Employees Union, Friedman also targeted Trump's executive order and granted a motion for a preliminary injunction.

American Foreign Service Association President Tom Yazdgerdi called the ruling ""a significant victory—not just for our members, but for the integrity of the Foreign Service and for the accountability and transparency of our member agencies,"" according to a press release issued by the union.
""President Trump eliminated collective bargaining agreements that risk national security interests. He will always prioritize public safety for the American people,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement the White House provided to Fox News Digital on Thursday.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newark-mayor-arrested-at-ice-facility-claims-he-was-targeted-after-court-hearing","Newark mayor arrested at ICE facility claims he was 'targeted' after court hearing","Ras Baraka, the progressive Newark Democratic mayor who was arrested for trespassing last week, said the fight over immigration is of biblical proportions, calling his arrest ""a David moment.""
Ras Baraka, the Democratic mayor of Newark, New Jersey, and a candidate for governor, appeared in federal court Thursday for a status conference after being arrested at an ICE facility last week on a trespassing charge.
""We believe that I was targeted in this,"" Baraka told reporters after his court date that discussed the charge against him after he was arrested at the Delaney Hall facility last week.
""I was the only person arrested. That's right. You know, I was the only person identified. I was the only person, you know, they put in a cell. You know, the only person, I think that was in cuffs to the whole process that's here this morning, going through this humiliation for these people.""
In court, Baraka's defense team contested his arrest and declined to take a plea deal while arguing that the government has not provided enough evidence to prove that he was lawfully arrested.

The defense had been hoping to go to trial by late July, but the judge said there may be aggressive discovery and time is needed to set a trial schedule.
Both the prosecution and defense will submit a schedule for the court's consideration and no next date has been set. The defense requested all exculpatory evidence be provided by May 19 and discovery by May 22, which both parties agreed to.
The trespassing charge against Baraka, a class C misdemeanor, has a statutory maximum sentence of 30 days in prison.
Dozens of protesters gathered outside the federal court building where several activists railed against the arrest of Baraka during a protest at Delaney Hall attended by three members of Congress, who said they were in attendance to perform their congressionally-mandated oversight duties related to federal detention facilities.
""Newark has become an epicenter for ICE’s terror and overreach,"" Viri Martinez, manager of member empowerment at New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, told the crowd outside the court.

""They tried their best to humiliate me and degrade me, you know, as much as they possibly can,"" Baraka said after the court proceeding, explaining that he was fingerprinted and his mug shot was taken in the basement of the court.
""But, I still feel. I still I feel like what we did was completely correct. Yes. We did not violate any laws. We stood up for the Constitution of this country, the Constitution, the state of New Jersey. And we stood up for the local laws, that were put together by the people of this city. And by the people of this state.""
The three congressional lawmakers and Baraka were outside the ICE facility last week with a group of protesters when the gates opened to allow an ICE bus in. All four officials then allegedly rushed through the gates and past security, according to officials from the Department of Homeland Security.
The arrest came as activists had been calling for access to the facility for days, which is a privately run facility that was revamped as an immigration detention facility this year.

""The Mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center in Newark, New Jersey this afternoon,"" U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba, who was present at the courtroom on Thursday, posted on social media after Baraka's arrest.
Protesters could be heard shouting ""Shame, shame, shame"" at Habba as she entered the courtroom.

Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan grilled U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer on the practicalities of ending universal injunctions on Thursday, a major sticking point in a highly watched case centered on birthright citizenship and the power of lower courts to rule against the executive branch.
Kagan pressed Sauer on Thursday on ending universal injunctions and how the higher court should then be tasked with managing the flow of lower court challenges.
She also noted that the Trump administration has been ""losing uniformly"" in lower court cases on the ""substantive question"" in dealing with birthright citizenship.

The order reinterprets the 14th Amendment to deny automatic U.S. citizenship to children born in the U.S. if their mother is unlawfully present or temporarily in the country, and if their father is neither a U.S. citizen nor a lawful permanent resident at the time of birth. Trump's action remains on hold nationwide pending Supreme Court intervention.
A Supreme Court decision here could have sweeping national implications, setting a precedent that would affect the more than 310 federal lawsuits that have challenged White House actions since Trump's second presidency began on Jan. 20, according to a Fox News data analysis.

A new national poll released this week is one of the first to indicate a bump up in President Donald Trump's approval ratings after a steady edging down in the president's numbers since he returned to office in January.
Trump stands at 44% approval and 52% disapproval in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Monday and Tuesday (May 12-13). The president's approval rating edged up two points — which is within the survey's sampling error — from the previous Reuters/Ipsos national survey, which was in the field late last month.
US-CHINA TRADE TRUCE IGNITES STOCK MARKETS

Likely fueling the modest increase in the president's overall approval rating is his performance on the economy. The new poll indicates 39% of adults nationwide give Trump a thumbs up on how he is handling the economy, up three points from last month.
The new poll was conducted amid this week's surge in the stock markets following a truce between the U.S. and China in their tariff standoff, and in the wake of last week's signing of an initial trade deal with the U.K. — which is the first since Trump implemented massive tariffs on friends and foes across the globe six weeks ago.
WHAT'S IN THE TRADE TRUCE WITH CHINA
Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement in early April sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners and triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession.

However, as Trump has partially reversed course in recent weeks by easing back on his sharpest trade moves, public concerns about recession have also slightly eased, while still remaining at heightened levels.
Sixty-nine percent questioned in the new poll said they were worried about a recession, down from 76% a month ago. Additionally, concerns about the stock market dropped seven points, to 60%.
Veteran Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News that the president has ""been very clear-eyed about the fact that you are going to have to break some eggs to make an omelet and his voters will give him the latitude to do so.
""We’re still less than 150 days in, he’s got some time to make the hard calls that have to be made and still give the economic plane runway to take off ahead of the midterms, which is when all of these early decisions will be graded,"" Reed added.
WHERE TRUMP STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL
Most, but not all, of the most recent national public opinion surveys indicate Trump's approval ratings in negative territory, which is a slide from the president's poll position when he started his second tour of duty in the White House nearly four months ago.
Trump stood at 44% approval and 55% disapproval in the most recent Fox News national poll, which was conducted April 18-21.
(Fox News )
An average of the latest national surveys puts the president's approval rating underwater by around four points, but that is a slight improvement from late last month.
The economy, and inflation in particular, were pressing issues that kept former President Joe Biden's approval ratings well below water for most of his presidency, and which greatly contributed to Trump's White House victory last November.
They were behind Trump's slide in the polls so far this year.

""Trump’s return to office did not begin as he and his supporters had hoped. Campaign promises about inflation and interest rates appeared deferred while the daily news coverage focused on the many distractions plaguing the White House,"" longtime political scientist and analyst Wayne Lesperance noted.
However, Lesperance, president of New England College, said that ""signs of progress may be emerging. Possible trade deals with Britain, China, and India are providing hope that some good may come from his tariff strategy. Add to that a rebounding stock market and lower gas prices at the start of summer vacation season and the president may see some calming of public nervousness.""

President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at slashing U.S. drug prices has divided Democrats on Capitol Hill, with some cautiously optimistic while others dismissed the move as a bluster.
Most Democratic lawmakers who spoke with Fox News Digital about the order noted they had not read into the details, but the reactions were mostly split.
""It certainly seems more bark than it is bite,"" Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the House Ways & Means Committee, told Fox News Digital.
Neal said it ""strikes me as though it's another example of the executive order that garners a lot of attention"" with little impact, though he noted he was still looking into the details.

Rep. George Latimer of New York, a first-term Democrat who unseated a former member of the progressive ""Squad,"" ex-Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., signaled he was hopeful about the initiative.
""If we can keep drug costs low, that's a positive thing,"" Latimer said. ""I don't, you know, oppose everything the president does, things that help people lower costs. If that's what this turns into, then yes, it's a worthwhile idea. But I have to be honest, I've got to read it more closely to understand it better.""
Trump announced Monday that he was directing the Department of Health and Human Services to set price targets for pharmaceutical companies.
The president said the order would have pharmaceutical companies set drug prices on par with the lowest prices in other developed countries.
He said, ""some prescription drug and pharmaceutical prices will be reduced almost immediately by 50 to 80 to 90%.""
Democratic Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., told Fox News Digital when asked about the order, ""It's always a good thing to reduce drug costs.""
""I think it's a move in the right direction, let's just see the details,"" Correa added.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, like Neal, told Fox News Digital he was more skeptical.
""My feeling is that, like his…announcements during his first term, there's much talk and no meaningful reduction of drug prices,"" Doggett said. ""It remains to be seen whether any patient in America will see a price reduced on a single drug as a result of this order. So, until I see action, I will not believe that he has truly committed to reducing prices.""
House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., also said he did not believe Trump was ""serious"" when asked.
""All of this is just a disingenuous effort…on the part of House Republicans and Donald Trump, to pretend like they were looking out for people,"" Aguilar said. ""If they were serious about it, the policy would be placed within their reconciliation bill. It's not. This is just a performance effort by the president.""

Democrats have accused Republicans of using the bill to gut critical programs like Medicaid for millions of people who need it, while the GOP has contended it was just trying to eliminate waste and abuse within the system.
""It's the Democrats' fault that people are being ripped off for years and years. And now I hear Democrats saying, 'Oh, well, we're going to not go for the bill.' It's going to be very hard for them not to approve of the big, beautiful bill that we're doing,"" Trump said. ""We're doing the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country because people are going to be getting a 50 to a 90% reduction on drug prices.""
When reached for comment on Democrats' responses, White House spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital, ""Democrats talk; President Trump delivers. Instead of again putting politics over the American people, Democrats should work with the Trump administration to build on the President’s historic action to lower drug prices and end global freeriding off the backs of Americans.""

The Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments Thursday on a challenge to President Donald Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship, and crucially, whether lower courts that have blocked Trump's policies from taking force nationwide have acted beyond their authority.
Any decision from the 6–3 conservative majority could have sweeping implications for Trump's presidency as his lawyers spar against an onslaught of lawsuits in federal courts nationwide.
The Supreme Court arguments are focusing on lower court judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state who issued ""universal"" injunctions against Trump's birthright citizenship executive order earlier this year.
The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court in March to intervene and limit the scope of three lower court rulings to cover only individuals directly impacted by the relevant courts (or potentially, the 22 states that challenged Trump's executive order). But that's unlikely to be the primary theme at the center of Thursday’s high-profile debate.

Rather, justices are expected to use the oral arguments to weigh the authority of lower courts to issue nationwide, or ""universal"" injunctions blocking presidential policies — teeing up a high-stakes showdown that pits Trump's Article II powers against Article III courts.
The hearing comes as Trump and his allies have railed against so-called ""activist"" judges, whom they have accused of overstepping their powers and acting politically to block Trump's policies. The president even suggested that a federal judge in Washington, D.C., be impeached for his ruling earlier this year, which prompted a rare public rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.

Trump has signed more than 150 executive orders in his second term, inviting a seemingly unrelenting wave of challenges in court. Many of these orders have been blocked by federal judges across the country, who have restricted Trump's use of a 1798 wartime immigration law to deport certain migrants, ordered the administration to reinstate certain government personnel and sought to impose limits on Elon Musk's government efficiency organization, DOGE, among other orders.
While Trump allies accuse these judges of political bias and overreach, others critical of the administration say the courts have not gone far enough to rein in Trump's attempts to expand the executive branch's powers.
""The second Trump administration has taken the guardrails off of the norms that historically governed the rule of law, and is undertaking steps to enhance the perceived power of the executive branch to the detriment of the two other co-equal branches,"" Mark Zaid, a D.C.-based attorney who has sued Trump in several high-profile cases, told Fox News Digitial in an interview to mark his first 100 days in office.

But the policy remains widely unpopular. More than 22 U.S. states and immigrants' rights groups have sued the Trump administration to block the change to birthright citizenship, arguing in court filings that the executive order is both unconstitutional and ""unprecedented.""
And to date, no court has sided with the Trump administration's executive order seeking to ban birthright citizenship, though multiple district courts have blocked it from taking effect.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/espionage-constitutional-concerns-abound-from-trump-detractors-allies-over-qatari-jet-offer","Espionage, constitutional concerns abound from Trump detractors, allies over Qatari jet offer","President Donald Trump expresses disappointment in Boeing for taking 'so long' in building a new Air Force One when asked about the $400 million luxury plane gifted by Qatar.
Both Democrats and Republicans have criticized President Donald Trump after he announced the Department of Defense plans to accept a jumbo jet from the government of Qatar, arguing the gift is riddled with both espionage concerns and constitutional questions. But as one expert tells Fox, the latter concern is likely overblown.
Trump ally Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for example, said during an interview on Tuesday that the acquisition of the plane poses ""significant espionage and surveillance problems,"" while Democrats such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., declared, ""Trump cannot accept a $400 million flying palace from the royal family of Qatar. Not only is this farcically corrupt, it is blatantly unconstitutional.""
Reports spread Sunday morning that the Trump administration was expected to accept a $400 million Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar's royal family, setting off concerns that Trump would personally take ownership of the plane and violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution. ABC News reported that Trump would use the jet until the end of his term, when it would be given to his presidential library.
Trump confirmed and clarified in a Truth Social post later on Sunday that the Department of Defense was slated to receive the gift, while slamming Democrats for their criticism of the offer.
HOUSE DEMOCRAT CALLS FOR 'IMMEDIATE' ETHICS PROBE OF QATARI PLANE GIFT TO TRUMP

""So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,"" Trump wrote. ""Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA.""
At the heart of Democrats' concern over the matter is the emoluments clause in the Constitution, which states: ""No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.""
""Trump is literally trying to fly around on a plane from a foreign government while serving as president. That’s a violation of the Constitution. The Emoluments Clause wasn’t a suggestion. It’s the LAW,"" Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said Monday morning following the announcement.
Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation's Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that it's questionable if the emoluments clause even applies to the president, as the Constitution typically stipulates when a clause specifically affects a president and cites the title, such as in the impeachment clause.

""The clause was specifically inserted because of concerns by the Founders at the Constitutional Convention over corruption of our foreign diplomats, especially by the French government. It is questionable whether the emoluments clause even applies to the president since he is not named and the Constitution usually names the president when a provision applies to him. That is why the impeachment clause specifically provides that it applies to the ‘president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States.’ If ‘officers’ of the U.S. included the president, there would be no need for him to be separately listed,"" von Spakovsky explained.
He added that the president is the individual ""who appoints the ‘officers’ who are subject to the emoluments clause.""
""Antonin Scalia, when he worked at the Justice Department, certainly agreed since he issued an opinion in 1974 pointing out that when the Constitution refers to an ‘officer,’ ‘it invariably refers to someone other than the President or Vice President,’"" he continued.
FLASHBACK: DEM CRITICAL OF TRUMP'S QATARI JET GIFT RODE CAMEL IN EXPENSES-PAID 2021 TRIP TO GULF EMIRATE
The jet offer comes after Trump railed against Boeing for pricey government deals to construct a new fleet of Air Force Ones. Even ahead of his first administration, Trump posted on social media in December 2016 that the Boeing ""costs are out of control, more than $4 billion"" to build the two aircraft.
Trump in 2018 awarded Boeing a $3.9 billion fixed-price agreement to manufacture two new jets. The construction of the jets, however, is not expected to be completed until 2029.

""We're very disappointed that it's taking Boeing so long to build a new Air Force One,"" Trump said during a press conference on drug prices Monday morning. ""You know, we have an Air Force One that's 40 years old. And if you take a look at that, compared to the new plane of the equivalent, you know, stature at the time, it's not even the same ballgame.""
TRUMP CLARIFIES OWNERSHIP OF AIRCRAFT IN DEFENSE OF QATAR'S GIFT
""When I first came in, I signed an order to get (the new Air Force One fleet) built,"" he continued. ""I took it over from the Obama administration, they had originally agreed. I got the price down much lower. And then, when the election didn't exactly work out the way that it should have, a lot of work was not done on the plane because a lot of people didn't know they made change orders. That was so stupid, so ridiculous. And it ended up being a total mess, a real mess.""
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also brushed off concern over the Qatari royal family donating a Boeing jumbo jet to the U.S. Department of Defense, arguing on Monday there will be no quid pro quo arrangement and that the donation is under legal review to ensure full compliance with the law.
Von Spakovsky said that if the plane is in fact a government-to-government gift – and not a personal gift to the president – the Trump administration is likely in the legal clear to accept the gift.
""If this gift is being considered as a gift to the government of the U.S., there is no legal issue to consider, since there is no constitutional or legal problem with such a gift. If this is a personal gift to the president, the Justice Department would be weighing the constitutional issue I have raised – whether the emoluments clause even applies to the president,"" he said.

Von Spakovsky said such a government-to-government gift ""is no different than the thousands of cherry trees gifted to the U.S. by the Japanese government"" in 1912 that still draw more than a million tourists to Washington, D.C., each spring.
Allies of the president, such as Cruz, said espionage concerns weigh heavily over the planned deal, citing Qatar's ties to terrorist groups.
""I’m not a fan of Qatar. I think they have a really disturbing pattern of funding theocratic lunatics who want to murder us, funding Hamas and Hezbollah. And that’s a real problem,"" Cruz said during an interview Tuesday on CNBC.
""I also think the plane poses significant espionage and surveillance problems,"" he added. ""We’ll see how this issue plays out, but I certainly have concerns.""

Democrats, such as Sens. Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Dick Durbin of Illinois also warned that the plane would come with security issues. Reed, for example, claimed in a statement that using the plane as Air Force One ""would pose immense counterintelligence risks by granting a foreign nation potential access to sensitive systems and communications.""
While Democrats and some Republicans have criticized Trump over the move, other Republican lawmakers have said they are zoned in on legislative matters and are not looped into the plane issue.
""I actually haven't paid attention to it,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., previously told Fox News Digital. ""I'm sorry to be so out of the loop on that. I've just been thinking about Medicaid and about what the House is sending over.""

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, another Trump ally, said she didn't know enough about the deal to comment on it when pressed by Fox News Digital. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Eric Schmitt of Missouri also said they did not know details of the plane.

The plane is not expected to be presented to the president nor accepted by Trump during his trip abroad.
""The Boeing 747 is being given to the United States Air Force/Department of Defense, NOT TO ME!"" Trump posted to his Truth Social account while in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. ""It is a gift from a Nation, Qatar, that we have successfully defended for many years. It will be used by our Government as a temporary Air Force One, until such time as our new Boeings, which are very late on delivery, arrive.""

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Politico that there is no question that former President Joe Biden declined cognitively during his White House tenure.

Murphy suggested during that interview that Biden should ""show the country that he is still the old Joe Biden,"" saying that he took Biden ""at his word"" that he was still able to do his job.
""I have seen him do this job at an absolutely exceptional level. No president has had this level of legislative accomplishment in their first four years as Joe Biden,"" Murphy said.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee debated green energy cuts during their lengthy markup on Capitol Hill this week as part of the House budget reconciliation process.
Meanwhile, House Republicans debated potentially raising taxes as Trump indicated his support for a small tax hike to fund his ""big, beautiful bill."" While rumors swirled among House Republicans for weeks that the White House was floating a tax hike on millionaires, Trump confirmed on Friday he would be ""OK if they do.""
However, House Republicans seemed to drop their plans for a new millionaire's tax hike as the reconciliation began. The House Ways and Means Committee released nearly 400 pages of legislation on Monday that did not include a tax hike.

It's no coincidence that AFP is focusing its attention on competitive districts in Arizona, Iowa, Michigan and Pennsylvania, as contentious races are expected in 2026.
In Arizona's sixth congressional district, Ciscomani won his House seat in 2022 with just over 50% of the vote. Schweikert narrowly won Arizona's first congressional district by less than 2% of the vote in 2022 and 2024, as one of the most expensive House races in the country last year.
And while Hinson won by a much larger margin in Iowa's second congressional district, Democrat Kevin Techau has already announced his campaign to unseat Hinson.

President Donald Trump attended a breakfast with business leaders at the St. Regis Doha hotel in Qatar on Thursday morning where he remained firm that Tehran must choose between never having a nuclear weapon or dealing with ""violence like people haven't seen before.""
Just days before, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian had made comments that calls to dismantle Tehran's nuclear facilities were ""unacceptable,"" and that ""Iran will not give up its peaceful nuclear rights under any circumstances and will not back down from its rights in the face of pressure.""
Trump suggested Iran may now be informally moving toward compliance with international demands to halt its nuclear weapons ambitions, but emphasized that a final agreement has not yet been reached.

""It's not like I have to give you 30 pages' worth of details. There's only one sentence. They can't have a nuclear weapon.

He went on to state simply that there were limited options when it came to the deal and that he personally would rather go the more amicable route.
""There's two steps. There's a very, very nice step, and there's a violent step. There’s violence like people haven't seen before, and I hope we're not going to have to do this. I don't want to do the second step. Some people do. Many people do. I don't want to do that step,"" he said.

Other countries are much further away, so probably it's not quite the same level of danger, but we are going to protect this country. It is a very special place with a special royal family,"" Trump said.

In her first interview since announcing her bid for Alaska governor, Bernadette Wilson, a former radio host and longtime conservative figure in Alaska, spoke to Fox News Digital about the issues in the race and working with the Trump administration on energy development.
Wilson, a lifelong Alaskan who was born on the Kenai Peninsula and grew up in Anchorage, is a political outsider. Even so, politics does run in her family. Her great-uncle Wally Hickel served as governor, first in the 1960s as a Republican and again in the early 1990s as a member of the Alaska Independence Party.
She noted she comes from a long line of business people, including her grandfather, who ""built a good chunk"" of the state’s largest city.
""I myself own a garbage company … and we are celebrating our ninth year in business,"" she said. She added that her entrepreneurial experience and knowledge of state politics through her family history and own career in radio and activism is a good mix.
RANKED CHOICE VOTING RANKLES ELECTION SEASON
Alaska gubernatorial candidate Bernadette Wilson (Bernadette Wilson for Governor)
Wilson opposes ranked choice voting, in which votes are tallied in a hierarchical manner through several rounds. Conservatives in the red state blamed ranked choice voting for the election of former Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola. Incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited.
""Ranked choice voting disenfranchises voters. We see that it is … so confusing to them. We see people who don't understand the process, and it absolutely has got to go. That is mission-critical,"" she said.
In other states, ranked choice voting has had mixed reviews. In Virginia, proponents on the right credited it with helping the state party select businessman Glenn Youngkin as its nominee for governor in 2021, which led to a major Republican upset that fall.
ALASKA CAN BE CURE FOR NATION'S ILLS WITH HELP FROM TRUMP ADMIN: GOVERNOR SAYS
Energy is the most important economic topic for Alaska, and Wilson said she looks forward to working with the Trump administration on its stated plan for a domestic energy renaissance if she's elected.
""Energy is obviously huge for Alaska. Under the Biden administration, Alaska was sanctioned more times than … the country of Iran,"" she said.
""We have the ability to lead the rest of the country [in this field].""
Asked about another Trump-related topic, the ongoing tit-for-tat with Canada over claims to make it the 51st state and Ottawa’s bipartisan outrage at American tariffs, Wilson said, as governor, she would want to work on cross-border infrastructure projects.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/el-chapos-family-members-cross-us-border-apparent-deal-trump-administration","El Chapo's family members cross US border in apparent deal with Trump administration","El Centro sector Chief Patrol Agent Gregory Bovino breaks down why two U.S. citizens were charged with smuggling children at the southern border on 'The Story.'
Mexican officials said Wednesday that 17 family members of drug cartel leaders crossed into the United States last week as part of a deal between a son of the former head of the Sinaloa Cartel and the Trump administration.
Mexican Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch confirmed a report by independent journalist Luis Chaparro that family members of Ovidio Guzmán López had entered the U.S. Lopez, the son of imprisoned Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán, was extradited to the U.S. in 2023.
Among the family members allowed into the U.S. was Guzman's former wife, Griselda López Pérez.

In a radio interview, García Harfuch said it was clear to Mexican authorities the deal was made during negotiations between Guzmán López and the U.S. government.
""It is evident that his family is going to the U.S. because of a negotiation or an offer that the Department of Justice is giving him,"" García Harfuch said.
None of the family was being pursued by Mexican authorities.
Video footage posted online Tuesday by Spanish-language outlet Radio Formula shows Guzmán's family carrying luggage as they wait to be processed at the Tijuana/San Diego border crossing. They reportedly packed $70,000 in cash with them.

The confirmation by García Harfuch came the same day the office of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced it was charging a number of top cartel leaders with ""narcoterrorism"" for the first time since the Trump administration declared a number of cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.
""Let me be direct, to the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, you are no longer the hunters, you are the hunted,"" U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon for the Southern District of California said. ""You will be betrayed by your friends, you will be hounded by your enemies and you will ultimately find yourself and your face here in a courtroom in the Southern District of California.""
Guzmán López, 35, also known as ""the Mouse,"" is one of the four of Guzmán's sons known as ""Los Chapitos,"" who ran the Sinaloa Cartel in their father's absence. At his peak, the elder Guzmán was one of the most powerful drug traffickers in the world, turning the Sinaloa Cartel into a major force and one of the largest groups responsible for illegal drugs pouring into the U.S.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-struggle-trumps-mixed-signals-big-beautiful-bill","Republicans struggle with Trump's mixed signals on 'big, beautiful bill'","Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on President Donald Trump’s potential millionaire tax amid House Republican efforts to cut taxes on ‘Fox News @ Night.’
It’s hard enough to know what you want. It’s even harder to know what others want. But what if what you want hinges on what somebody else wants…and they aren’t sure what they want?
Hence the conundrum now facing Congressional Republicans as they try to approve the ""big, beautiful bill.""
GOPers are waiting for President Trump to push for very specific items to be in the bill – or fall by the wayside.
Congressional Republicans are aligned closely with the President and willing to bend to his wishes. But it complicates things when Trump calls for what he termed a ""tiny"" tax increase for the super wealthy.
TRUMP SAYS TAX RAISES ARE ‘GOOD POLITICS,’ DISMISSING GOP CRITICS

""People would love to do it. Rich people. I would love to do it, frankly. Giving us something up top in order to make people in the middle income and the lower income brackets [have] more. So, it's really a redistribution,"" said the president.
First, President Trump suggested a form of rations, limiting how many pencils kids need or how many dolls a little girl should have. That puzzled free marketeers in the GOP.
Now, to use his phrase, ""redistribution.""
You understand how much heartburn this gives capitalists in Congress. But what’s worse is the mixed messaging.
When writing on Truth Social about creating a higher tax bracket for the wealthy, the president muddled his instructions for lawmakers:
""Republicans should probably not do it, but I’m OK if they do!!!"" declared President Trump.
CIVIL WAR THREATENS GOP OVER MILLIONAIRE TAX HIKES IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'
This exasperated Congressional Republicans who oppose raising any taxes – a long-held tenet of the Republican Party.
In another political universe, taxing the wealthy would be – at best – a trial balloon. So, most Congressional Republicans decided it was time for this to pop.
""No, we are not going to do tax increases,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., on Fox Business.

""We don't want to raise taxes on anybody. I mean, we're about lowering taxes on Americans,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Fox.
But President Trump’s Republican Party is very different from the Reagan Republican Party. The GOP shifts to where Trump wants it. Just consider the approach to tariffs compared to free trade.
TRUMP PUSHES TAX HIKES FOR WEALTHY AS 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' DEADLINE LOOMS
President Trump broadened the party’s base in the last election. The GOP is no longer dominated by big business, titans of commerce and the well-to-do. Part of the president’s appeal was the blue-collar coalition he cobbled together. And his fundamental economic message on taxes resonated with millions of voters. That’s why his top advisers say Trump is sticking to campaign promises.
""President Trump has made it clear that he has his priorities, like no tax on tips. No tax on overtime. No tax on Social Security,"" said National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on Fox.
However, revenue generated from new taxes on the wealthy could help cover the cost of spending cuts.
""We need to see what we need to do with the math to make sure that we are doing the country well fiscally and that we don't just add to the debt,"" said Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb.
But Republicans are frustrated after House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shrank the size of the tax cuts and spending reductions.
The tax breaks were supposed to be around $4.5 trillion at one point. They dwindled to $4 trillion. They were angling to lock in $2 trillion in tax cuts. They’re scaled back to $1.5 trillion.
'HARD NO': MILLIONAIRE TAX HIKE PROPOSAL HAS HOUSE REPUBLICANS DIVIDED
""Republicans talk a big game in campaigns,"" lamented House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas. ""If we're not able to bend the curve on mandatory spending, then we will send a very bad signal to the bond markets.""
But regardless of what’s in the package, the White House is expecting Congressional Republicans to ultimately vote yes on the ""big, beautiful bill.""
""The president has great political instincts. That's why he's back in the Oval Office,"" said White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.
But that’s what Congressional Republicans found so vexing. The president may have great political instincts. But the marching orders were far from clear.
Trump conceded that a tax hike may be controversial politically.
Congressional Republicans suffer from political PTSD. They remember another Republican President who made one of the most famous political promises of all time. And then broke it.

""No new taxes,"" intoned the late President George H.W. Bush in his address to a Joint Session of Congress in 1989.
But Bush famously reversed himself as part of a 1990 budget pact. That was not necessarily the reason ""Bush 41"" lost reelection in 1992 to former President Clinton. And President Trump was sure enough to point that out on social media.
TRUMP SLAMS REPUBLICAN ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ OPPOSING BUDGET BILL, PREDICTS MASSIVE US TAX INCREASES IF IT FAILS
""The Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, ‘Read my lips,’ the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election!"" wrote Trump.

The ""Perot Effect"" certainly deprived George H.W. Bush of a second term more than breaking the ""no new taxes"" promise. But that doesn’t mean that Republicans aren’t skittish about voting for tax increases.
And regardless, the legislative product that emerged from the Ways and Means Committee markup this week lacked the type of tax hike dangled by President Trump.
That said, Congressional Republicans certainly have their opinions about what they think of the developing ""big, beautiful bill.""
""A growing number of us, we don’t want smoke and mirrors. We want real cuts,"" said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. ""$2 trillion (in cuts) is really a teardrop in the ocean.""
""You’ve got front-loaded tax [cuts]. Backloaded spending restraint,"" groused Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas. ""Medicaid reforms and work requirements don’t kick in for four years.""
""It’ll be ironic and sad in a way that conservatives will be voting for the largest increase in the debt ceiling,"" mused Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. ""I have a feeling it’s going to be wimpy on the spending cuts and maybe a little wimpy on the taxes, too.""
So, at least some Republicans grasp what they want in the bill. And they’re willing to take direction from the president. That’s why clear direction from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. will be key next week as the House tries to pass the measure.

Members will say they can’t vote for the bill because it has this or excludes that. But they just might be able to vote yea if President Trump knows what he wants – and makes that clear to lawmakers.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/abortion-ban-could-return-missouri-after-voters-amended-state-constitution-protect-procedure","Abortion ban could return to Missouri after voters amended state Constitution to protect procedure","Fox News Digital spoke to SBA Director of Legal Affairs Katie Glenn Daniel about a study showing that 1 in 10 women suffer severe side effects from taking mifepristone.
Missouri's near-complete abortion ban could possibly return if a new ballot measure just passed by the state legislature gets approval from voters.
The GOP-controlled Missouri Senate passed a proposed constitutional amendment Thursday, which would repeal an earlier constitutional amendment passed by voters last year that enshrined abortion protections in the state's constitution. Democrats sought to fillibuster the move Wednesday, but Republicans used procedural rules to get around it, according to The Associated Press.
The proposed amendment, which passed in Missouri's GOP-controlled House last month, would go on the state's ballots in Missouri's 2026 general election.
However, the amendment could be voted on sooner if Missouri's Republican governor chooses to call a special election on the issue.

""Senate Republicans are overturning the will of the voters and pushing to bring an Abortion Ban back to Missouri. This new ballot item will ban abortion and take away a right that voters secured just six months ago,"" the Missouri Senate Democrats X account posted Wednesday.
After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, several Republican states had trigger laws on the books that immediately went into effect and imposed stricter abortion regulations at the state level. Missouri was one of those states, and was among the first in the nation to enact a post-Roe abortion ban.
Missouri's trigger law made all abortions in the state illegal, except during circumstances when the life of the mother is at risk.

But, in 2024, a citizen-initiated constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion protections into the state's constitution ultimately repealed Missouri's trigger law. The ballot measure, known as Amendment 3, was voted on in November and passed, but by a very narrow margin.
Missouri Republicans sought to include messaging in the ballot amendment that explicitly says it will repeal Amendment 3, but it did not pass, according to the Missouri Independent.

Providence, Rhode Island, officials have accepted a request to fly the Palestinian flag Friday at City Hall in the state's capital.
City officials emphasized that no American flags are being displaced by the display, adding there have been several other flags raised over the government office in the past.
""Providence City Hall displays many different flags throughout the year to mark different occasions and honor the many ethnic and cultural backgrounds and traditions that make our city strong,"" a spokesperson for Providence City Council told Fox News Digital Wednesday.
The spokesperson added the city has also flown the Dominican flag, Irish flag, Armenian flag and the Israeli flag in recent months.

""Like those examples, this idea came to us from the community as part of a request to honor the important role Palestinian-Americans play in the fabric of our beautifully diverse city,"" the spokesperson said.
Council President Rachel Miller will display the flag during Thursday’s city council meeting and then outside City Hall Friday.
When asked about the decision, a representative for Democratic Mayor Brett Smiley suggested the ceremony was the city council’s prerogative.

""In Providence, the executive branch and City Council are two separate branches of government. The Providence City Council, not Mayor Smiley’s office, will be raising the Palestinian flag on Friday,"" said Josh Estrella, a spokesman for Smiley.
A report from GoLocalProvidence added the Palestinian flag is reportedly becoming more prevalent at City Hall overall.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/watch-rfk-jr-rebukes-dem-senator-playing-politics-cancer-stricken-constituent-you-dont-care","WATCH: RFK Jr. rebukes Dem senator for playing politics with cancer-stricken constituent: 'You don't care'","HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., got into a heated back-and-forth about whether President Donald Trump's cuts at the National Institutes of Health have delayed critical patient care.
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. got into a heated debate with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., during a hearing on Capitol Hill Wednesday after the senator accused Kennedy and the Trump administration of delaying critical cancer care for one of her constituents named Natalie.
Kennedy told Murray he wanted to do ""everything"" in his power to help her constituent, telling the senator repeatedly to contact his office to go over the individual's case. But his answers were not adequate for the senator, leading Kennedy to eventually question whether the Washington state Democrat actually cared about her constituent, Natalie.
""Mr. Secretary, one of my constituents — her name is Natalie Phelps — she's a mom of two from Bainbridge Island in Washington state. She has been fighting aggressive stage four colorectal cancer for nearly five years now. Her best hope now is a clinical trial she's participating in at the [National Institutes of Health's] Clinical Center,"" Murray said in her opening line of questioning directed at Kennedy.
BEN & JERRY'S CO-FOUNDER ARRESTED PROTESTING SENATE HEARING: 'RFK KILLS PEOPLE WITH HATE'
""But because of the thoughtless mass firing of thousands of critical employees across NIH and HHS that you carried out, Natalie's doctors at that clinical center have told her they have no choice but to delay her treatment by an additional four weeks.""
Murray added that those four weeks of delayed care ""could mean the difference between life and death"" for Natalie. She also demanded Kennedy give a ""specific"" number of how many employees have been cut at NIH's clinical center.

""I can't tell you that now, Sen. Murray,"" Kennedy responded. ""What I can tell you is that if you contact my office tomorrow, I'll look specifically into that.""
However, that answer from Kennedy was ""not acceptable"" to the senator.
""That is not acceptable. I want an answer,"" Murray shot back, eventually demanding Kennedy provide her an update on Natalie's case within 24 hours.

""Wouldn't you rather get her into that clinical trial as fast as you can?"" Kennedy shot back.

""All right, so if you contact my office tomorrow, this is a …,"" Kennedy said before Murray cut him off.
""Natalie is sitting there waiting for treatment, you're here to …"" Murray said before Kennedy interjected to remind her he was trying to help with Natalie's circumstances.
""I'm offering to help here, but you don't care. You don't care about Natalie,"" Kennedy told Murray, noting during the hearing he wanted do ""everything in [his] power to try to get Natalie into [the clinical trial quicker.]""

Following a recess, Kennedy said the patient, Natalie, was found to be ineligible for the clinical trial she was trying to get into. The patient was found to be ""medically ineligible,"" Kennedy said.
""It had nothing to do with the [reduction in force] and NIH had been trying to get her into another clinical trial, but none of our clinical trials were shut down because of the R.I.F. That was a canard.""
Kennedy's spat with Murray included different questions tied to the Trump administration's cuts, which Kennedy spent much of Wednesday on Capitol Hill fielding questions about. Kennedy also participated in a separate House hearing Wednesday that covered the matter and other issues HHS faces.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harvard-university-president-pay-cut-amid-trump-administration-funding-freeze","Harvard University president takes 25% pay cut amid Trump administration funding freeze","Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett joins 'FOX & Friends' to discuss the latest on the standoff between Harvard University and the Trump administration over federal funding and why he believes the school is facing an 'uphill battle.'
Harvard University President Alan Garber has agreed to voluntarily take a 25% reduction in pay for the 2025-26 school year, amid funding cuts imposed by the Trump administration, amounting to about $2.2 billion.
A Harvard University spokesperson told Fox News about the pay cut, adding that other leaders across the institution are making their own voluntary contributions, given the significant challenges the school faces.
The university announced a hiring pause in March, also asking ""schools and administrative units to scrutinize discretionary and non-salary spending, reassess the scope and timing of capital renewal projects, and conduct a rigorous review of any new multi-year commitments,"" the spokesperson noted.
Additionally, schools within the central administration at Harvard announced there would be no merit pay increases for faculty and staff for fiscal year 2026, which runs from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. The school also paused non-essential capital projects and spending.

This is not the first time Garber has taken a voluntary pay reduction. In April 2020, then-Provost Garber took a voluntary 25% pay cut as the school faced financial challenges caused by the pandemic.
The Harvard Crimson reported that past presidents have made up to $1 million annually.
Harvard has become a target of Trump’s broader crackdown on universities, much of which is in response to last year’s anti-Israel unrest that erupted on campuses across the country.

(Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images)
On April 11, the Trump administration sent a letter to Garber and Harvard Corporation Lead Member Penny Pritzker outlining the institution’s failures and a list of demands from the White House. In the letter, the administration accused Harvard of failing to uphold civil rights laws and to foster an ""environment that produces intellectual creativity.""
The Trump administration threatened to pull federal funding if Harvard did not reform governance and leadership as well as its hiring and admissions practices by August of this year. The letter emphasized the need for Harvard to change its international admissions process to avoid admitting students who are ""hostile"" to American values or support terrorism or antisemitism.

Harvard refused to comply with the demands, with Garber saying that ""no government… should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.""
The Trump administration then froze $2.2 billion in funding to Harvard and is reportedly looking to slash another billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.

The university later filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its ""unlawful"" freezing of funds.

A lone House Democrat pushing to impeach President Donald Trump has backed down from his effort to force a vote on the measure after pressure to do so from fellow liberals.
Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., aimed to force a vote on his seven articles of impeachment against Trump this week through a mechanism known as a privileged resolution that forces the House to reckon with a piece of legislation within two days of being in session.
Democratic leaders made their opposition to the effort known, however, and House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., told reporters it was a ""distraction.""
Thanedar later announced on X he would back off trying to force the vote.
ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION

It comes after Democrats, including House Progressive Caucus Chairman Greg Casar, D-Texas, pushed back on the effort. He said he would vote against the measure and called it ""unserious,"" according to Punchbowl News.
""This doomed impeachment vote is not about holding Trump accountable, but instead seems to be about the interest of the bill sponsor,"" Casar said.
House GOP leaders had planned a vote to table the measure, a procedural motion blocking a House-wide vote, but called it off after Thanedar apparently missed his window to force the vote.
Thanedar said in a statement on X afterward, ""In the fifteen days since I filed seven articles of impeachment against President Trump, he has committed more impeachable offenses, most dangerously, accepting a $400 million private jet from Qatar, which even Republican Members of Congress have called wrong.

""So, after talking with many colleagues, I have decided not to force a vote on impeachment today. Instead, I will add to my articles of impeachment and continue to rally the support of both Democrats and Republicans to defend the Constitution with me.""
Later, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said the situation ""speaks for itself"" when asked whether he pressured Thanedar to drop the motion.
Thanedar's resolution has caused a modest political headache for Democratic lawmakers at a time the party has struggled with messaging after the 2024 election.
""I have said before from this podium, this is not the right approach we should be taking,"" Aguilar said at his weekly press conference. ""I'll join members of the leadership team in voting to table that motion.""
Thanedar acknowledged his colleagues' concerns about his move during his own press conference Wednesday morning, though he insisted it would not deter him.
Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., called Thanedar's push a ""distraction"" (Fox News Digital)
""Even some Democrats call me a lunatic, just like the president has called me lunatic,"" the Michigan Democrat said.
""But they have never said, nobody has said to me, ‘Mr. Thanedar, the seven articles of impeachment that you presented to the U.S. Congress, they’re a piece of s---. They're not good. You missed it, missed the point. They are not legally right.' They didn't do that. No one says that.""
However, Aguilar said hours later it was not the right time to push an impeachment effort.
""This is such an impactful moment, and our colleagues are locking themselves in a room for 24 hours to protect and defend healthcare. We shouldn't be talking about this proposal that is not right, not timely,"" Aguilar said, referring to the House Energy and Commerce Committee's meeting on budget reconciliation, which has been ongoing since 2 p.m. Tuesday.
""This president is no stranger to impeachments. He's been impeached twice. Impeachment is a tool that can be used, but it takes weeks, months to do. Right now, the issue of the day is, will Hill Republicans stand up and support healthcare in this country?""
Hours before the expected vote, NBC News reported that House Democratic leaders pressed Thanedar not to show up for the chamber's 5 p.m. vote series, which would have meant he could not force the vote.
Republicans, meanwhile, seized on the disagreement.
""House Democrats have demonstrated once again they are willing to abuse the Constitution in their effort to impede the agenda of the American people,"" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement before the vote.
""Their latest sham impeachment charade against President Trump is another embarrassing political stunt. Today, House Republicans will move promptly to discard it.""

When reached for comment on Thanedar's push Tuesday, White House spokesperson Liz Huston told Fox News Digital, ""Every action taken by President Trump and his administration is fully lawful and firmly rooted in the will of the American people. President Trump is doing exactly what he promised: securing our border, bringing in trillions of dollars in investment to America and restoring common-sense leadership.""
""Meanwhile, Democrats are once again showing where their true priorities lie — siding with illegal immigrants over the safety, security and well-being of hardworking American citizens. This desperate impeachment stunt is nothing more than a reckless political act that the American people see right through,"" the White House said.

Kennedy Jr.'s testimony during a Senate HELP Committee hearing Wednesday, May 14, 2025.
Ben Cohen, one of the co-founders of the ice cream company Ben & Jerry's, was arrested on Capitol Hill Wednesday afternoon during a Senate hearing involving Health and Human Services (HHS) Department Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
United States Capitol Police (USCP) confirmed Tuesday afternoon that Cohen was among seven people arrested after they disrupted the hearing. While Cohen was only arrested on charges of obstruction, others involved in the protest were arrested for resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer, Capitol Police said.
However, it is unclear how many people were charged with the more severe violations.

Multiple people were eventually escorted out of the room, and  Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), paused the hearing.
In video of the disruption posted on X by The Daily Caller, Cohen can be seen being forcibly pulled out of the hearing room by a Capitol Police officer.

""Members of the audience are reminded disruptions will not be permitted while the committee conducts its business. Capitol Police are asked to remove the individuals from the hearing room,"" Cassidy said as Cohen was being wrangled out of the room.
""That was a made-for-C-SPAN moment,"" Cassidy quipped after things settled down.

Wednesday wasn't the first time Cohen has been arrested while protesting in the nation's capital. In 2023, he was arrested outside the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for blocking the entrance to the Department of Justice (DOJ) building in Washington, D.C., where he was protesting the detainment of Julian Assange.
Ben & Jerry's is frequently a target of Republicans, who have slammed the company and its founders over their support of progressive activism and politicians. They are also frequent critics of Trump.

Ben & Jerry's has been known for its left-leaning advocacy since its founding in 1978, and the Vermont-based ice cream maker was able to maintain an independent board of directors to continue its progressive activism even after it sold to Unilever in 2000.
One of those moments included a decision by Ben & Jerry's in 2021 that ended the sale of its products to Israelis in the West Bank, which the company refers to as ""Occupied Palestinian Territory.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/red-state-treasurer-reveals-why-state-financial-officers-have-obligation-to-combat-esg-dei-duty-of-care","Red state treasurer reveals why state financial officers have 'obligation' to combat ESG, DEI","Fox News Digital spoke to Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks at the State Financial Officers Foundation conference in Orlando, Florida.
EXCLUSIVE: As Republican state financial officers across the country move to rid the government of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social  and governance (ESG), Fox News Digital spoke to Utah’s state treasurer about the importance of bringing meritocracy and fiduciary responsibility back to markets and investments.
""ESG introduces another motive or another motivation to address societal issues through the capital markets or through investment, and when you do that, you violate the fiduciary standards that all of us as financial officers are committed to,"" Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks told Fox News Digital at the State Financial Officers Foundation conference in Orlando, Florida.
""And, so, because of that dual mandate, you really have problems when you're managing money for other people. If a single person wants to do it or a family wants to invest their money that way, that's their choice. But when you are managing money for other people, we don't have that choice. We have an obligation to do what's in their financial best interest.""
Oaks has been at the forefront of the fight against ESG, an investing principle critics say companies and institutions utilize to enact ""woke"" agendas, authoring several letters on the subject.

""When you talk about managing money for the benefit of other people, which is what a lot of state treasurers do, we have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the beneficiary,"" Oaks explained. ""So, we have the duty of loyalty and a duty of care.
""And it is really focused on the financial outcomes for the beneficiaries. They are depending on this money for their retirement, and, so, it is our financial obligation or fiduciary obligation to act in their best interests.""
Oaks said firefighters, teachers and police officers who depend on state pensions end up being harmed when states or companies are investing based on factors other than protecting investors.

""ESG introduces another motive or another motivation to address societal issues through the capital markets or through investment, and when you do that, you violate the fiduciary standards that all of us as financial officers are committed to,"" Oaks said.
Oaks and the other Republicans at the SFOF conference have also been vocal opponents of DEI measures and praised President Trump for his efforts to roll back DEI in government.

Oaks told Fox News Digital ESG and DEI are closely related and that his opposition to DEI also links back to the desire to do what's best for shareholders in his state.
""DEI — diversity, equity, inclusion — that's really the S portion, the social portion of ESG, and, again, it's important because a lot of the push by activist folks in the financial markets is to push an agenda onto corporate America, to have them adopt policies at companies that really are not in the best interest of the companies. And companies have a fiduciary obligation to their shareholders,"" Oaks said.

""When they introduce things like DEI, you change hiring practices, not for merit-based, it moves to other discriminatory hiring practices and ultimately harms companies and their financial output. And, so, that ultimately harms the teachers, the firefighters, the police officers that you're trying to help with their retirement.""
Oaks was one of two dozen state financial officers who sent a letter in March to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asset managers, proxy advisors and public companies, sounding the alarm on the financial risk of prioritizing a political agenda, like DEI, over financial returns.
Oaks told Fox News Digital that when DEI is introduced at the state financial officer level, ""we are potentially introducing financial harm.""
""And we've seen that with companies like Target, like Bud Light, you know, other companies that have adopted policies that are not in the financial best interest of the shareholders. They have harmed the shareholder value, and that ultimately harms the outcomes that these hardworking public servants and teachers, et cetera, that have worked so hard, retire with the money that they need.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gabbard-moves-presidential-daily-intelligence-brief-staff-from-cia-odni","Gabbard moves presidential daily intelligence brief staff from CIA to ODNI","DNI Tulsi Gabbard joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the effort to shut down intelligence leaks, how she has taken action against those leakers and the use of Signal for government officials to communicate.
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard moved the presidential daily brief staff from the CIA to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Fox News Digital confirmed.
A senior intelligence source told Fox News Digital that the director of National Intelligence ""has always controlled"" the presidential daily brief (PDB) and that Gabbard ""is just moving it physically to ODNI from CIA in a streamlining effort and a continuity of workforce.""
The PDB, according to the intelligence community, is a daily summary of high-level, all-source information and analysis on national security issues produced for the president and key cabinet members and advisers. It is coordinated and delivered by the ODNI with contributions from the CIA as well as other elements from the intelligence community. It has been presented to the president since 1946.
GABBARD FIRES 'DEEP STATE' HEADS OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE COUNCIL TO ROOT OUT 'POLITICIZATION OF INTEL'
The move comes after Gabbard, on Tuesday, also moved the National Intelligence Council from the CIA to ODNI. NIC, according to senior intelligence officials, has always been a DNI component.
""It makes sense for them to be physically located at DNI,"" a CIA official told Fox News Digital.
Another senior intelligence official pointed to Gabbard’s confirmation hearing, in which she said her ""priority was to deliver timely, accurate and actionable intelligence as the President’s principal intelligence advisor.""
""The PDB staff and the NIC are the primary apparatus that feeds her this advisory material, so moving them physically closer gives her the best support,"" the official said. ""In other words, having them in closer proximity gives her less lag time and faster responsiveness to fill that role as principal intelligence advisor.""
DNI GABBARD REFERS INTEL OFFICIALS TO DOJ FOR PROSECUTION OVER ALLEGED LEAKS OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
The official added: ""Both moves are about providing the President more timely and actionable intelligence.""
The moves come as Gabbard has taken steps to root out leakers and alleged ""deep state holdovers"" who officials say are politicizing intelligence analysis and ""trying to sabotage President Trump’s agenda.""
FLASHBACK: BIDEN CAMPAIGN, BLINKEN ORCHESTRATED INTEL LETTER TO DISCREDIT HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY, EX-CIA OFFICIAL SAYS
So far, Gabbard has referred three intelligence community professionals to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution over alleged leaks of classified information. Fox News Digital first reported on those criminal referrals in April.
(DNI.gov/AP)
An ODNI official at that time told Fox News Digital that the intelligence community professionals allegedly leaked classified information to the Washington Post and The New York Times.
Fox News Digital, on Tuesday, exclusively reported that Gabbard had fired the top officials leading National Intelligence Council, whom whistleblowers described as ""radically opposed to Trump.""
Gabbard fired Mike Collins, who was serving as the acting chair of the National Intelligence Council, and his deputy, Maria Langan-Riekhof, Tuesday, senior intelligence officials told Fox News Digital.
Fox News Digital reached out Langan-Riekhof for comment and did not immediately hear back, and couldn't immediately find contact information for Collins.
Collins also has whistleblower complaints against him for political bias and ""deliberately undermining the incoming Trump administration,"" officials said.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
They added that Collins was closely associated with Michael Morrell, the former deputy director of the CIA who worked to write a public letter in 2020 claiming that Hunter Biden's laptop had ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,"" and to get signatures from top ex-intelligence officials.
As for Langan-Reikhof, officials said she has been a ""key advocate"" for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and is someone who whistleblowers allege is ""radically opposed to Trump.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/budget-office-fundamentally-progressive-roots-used-dems-latest-tool-anti-trump-resistance","Budget office with 'fundamentally progressive roots' used by Dems as latest tool in anti-Trump resistance","Senate Majority Leader John Thune joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss Republican efforts to pass President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful' budget bill and the possibility of a wealth tax.
The White House is shutting down accusations from Democrats and anti-Trump ""resistance"" that nearly 14 million people will lose insurance coverage under Republican Medicaid reform proposals as part of President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" — with Republicans calling foul on the data spin and saying Dems are using it as a scare tactic.
The infighting comes as Democrats and Republicans are going head-to-head over Medicaid spending levels, which has emerged as a prominent wedge between the parties amid the release of new analysis suggesting millions of people would lose their health insurance in order to foot the bill for Trump’s tax cuts.
While Democrats have merged data from two new reports from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to back up claims that nearly 14 million would lose coverage, the White House and Republicans are objecting, as not all the policy proposals evaluated were actually included in Republicans' legislation, and far fewer people would actually face insurance loss.
Instead, Republicans argue that their proposed reforms to implement work requirements, strengthen eligibility checks and crack down on Medicaid for illegal immigrants preserve the program for those who really need it.

MEDICAID BECOMES FLASHPOINT IN HOUSE DEBATE OVER TRUMP BUDGET BILL
""President Trump is protecting Medicaid for every eligible American who relies on it by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse within this program,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a Tuesday statement to Fox News Digital. ""By taking commonsense measures to strengthen Medicaid, we will ultimately improve care for those who this program is intended to serve: pregnant women, the disabled, seniors, and low-income families.""
""The President has repeatedly said that he will save Medicaid to ensure it remains a reliable and sustainable lifeline for generations to come,"" Desai said.
A series of calculations from the CBO have recently emerged evaluating multiple different Medicaid proposals — further pitting Republicans and Democrats against one another on Medicaid reform.
Much of the CBO's Health Analysis Division consists of Democrats or Democrat donors, however, according to conservative government research nonprofit American Accountability Foundation, putting its standing as a nonpartisan organization into question, Fox News Digital. ""The CBO likes to call itself ‘nonpartisan’ in an attempt to disguise its role as an undercover leftist think tank,"" AAF President Tom Jones said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""In fact, the CBO is institutionally progressive, with 84% of its professional healthcare staff members being registered Democrats. These same staff members, who are on record donating to radicals like Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton, ‘score’ legislation and present it to the American people like it’s sacrosanct.""
The CBO declined to comment to Fox News Digital on these claims.
SENIOR HOUSE REPUBLICAN EVISERATES DEMS FOR ‘FEAR CAMPAIGN’ AGAINST TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’
Sen. Ron Wyden (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)
The first new CBO analysis, commissioned by Democrats and released Thursday, failed to examine the exact proposals Republicans are considering and instead, took a shot in the dark at what Republicans might introduce, according to experts.
That’s because Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., requested the CBO evaluate various policies that Republicans could have suggested. However, most of the policies analyzed are not identical to the ones that Republicans have actually put forward, experts said.
""That was Democrats trying to guess what Republicans were going to do,"" Ryan Long, a senior research fellow at the Paragon Health Institute, told Fox News Digital Monday.
Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies at the Washington-based libertarian-leaning Cato Institute think tank, voiced similar sentiments about the initial CBO report.
""The first thing to know is that this is not a Republican proposal that CBO was examining,"" Cannon told Fox News Digital Monday about the initial CBO analysis. ""They’re similar to Republican proposals, but these were proposals, ideas that the Democrats asked CBO to examine for the purposes of criticizing those proposals, using them as a CBO score as a cudgel against Republicans.""
While Democrats labeled the first scorekeeper’s report as proof that Republican policies would lead to ""catastrophic"" Medicaid cuts and force millions of people off their coverage, Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in a post on X that Democrats sought to ""fear monger"" Americans.
Ultimately, the CBO report released Thursday evaluated five different initiatives that would rein in Medicaid spending, freeing up billions of dollars in spending but jeopardizing healthcare coverage for up to 8.6 million people.
HOUSE GOP UNVEILS MEDICAID WORK REQUIREMENTS IN TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'
Additional analysis from the CBO released Monday claimed that an additional 5.1 million Americans could lose their coverage if the measure fails to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits that will expire in 2034, and includes a provision to fully implement the Marketplace Integrity Rule that seeks to crack down on eligibility verification.
Although neither of these proposals is included in the Republican legislation, Democrats have added the numbers from these two CBO reports and have asserted that roughly 13.7 million people would go uninsured under Republican policies.
Meanwhile, the latest CBO analysis released Tuesday examining Medicaid proposals included in the GOP measure found that adding work requirements, new eligibility checks and removing illegal immigrants from Medicaid would result in 10.3 million people losing coverage, and would leave 7.6 million people without insurance.
CBO declined to comment when reached by Fox News Digital on its recent reports.
ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION
Rep. Frank Pallone (Alex Brandon/The Associated Press)
Additionally, Cannon pushed back against accusations that any of the proposals would actually cut Medicaid funding. While federal Medicaid spending is set to increase by 4.5% annually, the proposals CBO evaluated would simply curb that growth to at least 3% annually.
But ultimately, Cannon said the report is a mechanism Democrats are using to ignite fears among Republicans as they seek a legislative victory of their own.
""Democrats want to beat up Republicans, of course they do,"" Cannon said. ""They want to win elections, and they think if they can scare people, they can do it… they don't want Republicans to get a political win, like tax cuts, and so this is their best weapon to stop tax cuts. They’re making the most of it, so that's what's going on with that CBO score.""
The tension between Republicans and Democrats over Medicaid funding stems from a larger battle over Trump’s budget package that is making its way through Congress.
Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is seeking to get the measure over the finish line in the House by Memorial Day.
Meanwhile, the House Energy and Commerce Committee unveiled a portion of the measure Sunday that tackled Medicaid, as the panel follows through on requests to find $880 billion in spending cuts to foot the bill for other Trump priorities.
Specifically, the committee’s proposal put forth policy initiatives, including a new 80-hour-per-month work requirement on certain able-bodied adults between the ages of 19 and 64 that receive Medicaid.
The measure also puts limits on how much states spend on expanded Medicaid populations established through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which permitted states to increase their Medicaid coverage to those who make up 138% of the poverty level.
Likewise, states that issue Medicaid coverage to illegal immigrants are in jeopardy of reduced federal Medicaid reimbursement funding under the measure. That would require the state to pick up additional costs.

Still, Democrats claimed that the effort would seize healthcare coverage from ""millions of Americans.""
""This is not trimming fat from around the edges, it’s cutting to the bone,"" Pallone said in a statement Sunday night. ""The overwhelming majority of the savings in this bill will come from taking healthcare away from millions of Americans. Nowhere in the bill are they cutting ‘waste, fraud, and abuse’ — they’re cutting people’s healthcare and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires.""

House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., said Democrats are attempting to ""scare"" Americans.
""Democrats are pedaling incorrect reports that include policies that aren’t even in the bill,"" Guthrie told Fox News Digital Monday.

""We’re considering a reconciliation bill that picks winners and losers and elevates expensive, outdated and inefficient sources like coal over cheap, American-made energy like solar, wind and storage,"" said Democratic California Rep. Scott Peters.

On Sunday, House lawmakers laid out plans to phase out key clean energy tax credits, slashing billions in spending related to electric vehicles and renewable energy and fast-track gas exports as part of a GOP push to pass a multitrillion-dollar budget to carry out President Donald Trump's agenda, Reuters reported.
The bill would repeal Environmental Protection Agency rules, including one that would slash allowed emissions for light- and medium-duty vehicles starting with 2027 models.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/four-months-trumps-second-term-democrats-remain-deeply-pessimistic-about-party","Four months into Trump's second term, Democrats remain deeply pessimistic about their party","Former Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and American Principles Project executive director Terry Schilling join 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss the Democratic Party's low congressional approval ratings as the party searches for direction.
Democrats remain pessimistic about the future of their party, six months after they suffered setbacks up and down the ballot at the hands of now-President Donald Trump and Republicans.
That's a key finding in a newly released national poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
According to the survey, only about one-third of Democrats are very or somewhat optimistic about the future of the Democratic Party. That's a steep decline from last July, when around six in 10 Democrats said they were optimistic.
The Democratic Party has been in the political wilderness since last November's elections, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. And Republicans made gains among Black and Hispanic voters as well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base.
HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING

The survey, conducted May 1-5, points to an increase in optimism among Republicans, with 55% more optimistic about the future of the GOP, up from 47% last summer.
Since Trump's return to power, an increasingly energized base of Democrats is urging party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration. And their anger is directed not only at Republicans but also at Democrats they feel aren't vocal enough in their opposition to Trump.
And that's fueled the plunge in the Democratic Party's favorable ratings, which have hit all-time lows in several new polls so far this year.
According to the AP-NORC survey, only around a third of all respondents have a positive view of the party. The GOP didn't fare much better, with only around four in 10 adults holding a favorable view of the Republican Party.
KAMALA HARRIS TAKES NEXT STEP IN RETURN TO POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT
Some top Democrats were sampled in the poll.
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the longtime progressive champion and 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential nomination runner-up, was viewed positively by roughly four in 10 Americans. But around three-quarters of self-described Democrats questioned held a favorable view of Sanders.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the progressive firebrand who has teamed up with Sanders this year for a series of large rallies across the country, was viewed positively by only three out of 10 adults. Around half of Democrats held a favorable opinion of the four-term representative, who is seen as a possible 2028 Democratic presidential contender.
There are also suggestions that Ocasio-Cortez may primary challenge longtime Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York when he's up for re-election in 2028.
POLL POSITION: WHERE TRUMP STANDS 15 WEEKS INTO HIS SECOND PRESIDENCY
Only 21% of adults view Schumer favorably. A third of self-described Democrats said they view him positively, but that's a dramatic drop from December, when half of Democrats questioned held a favorable opinion of the 74-year-old senator.
Many Democrats heavily criticized Schumer earlier this year for his support of a GOP-crafted funding bill that kept the federal government from shutting down.

The AP-NORC poll is the latest survey to spell trouble for the Democratic Party.
The Democrats' ratings stood underwater in the most recent Fox News national poll at 41% favorable and 56% unfavorable in a survey conducted April 18-21.
That's an all-time low for the Democrats in Fox News polling. And for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower than that of the GOP, which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable.
The figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys.
(Fox News )
The Democratic Party's favorable ratings were well in negative territory in a Pew Research national survey – 38% favorable, 60% unfavorable – conducted in early April and at 36% favorable, 60% unfavorable in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field a couple of weeks earlier.
And national polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University and March by CNN and by NBC News also indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows.
But there's more.
Confidence in the Democratic Party's congressional leadership sunk to an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll conducted early last month.
The confidence rating for Democrats' leadership in Congress stood at 25% in the survey, which was nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023.
And the semi-annual Harvard Youth Poll, which was released late last month, indicated that approval ratings for Democrats in Congress among Americans aged 18-29 nosedived.

An ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll conducted in mid-April indicated that more respondents trusted Trump (40%) than Democrats in Congress (32%) to handle the nation's main problems. The results came even as Trump's approval ratings have slid into negative territory since returning to the White House.
And a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted late last month suggested Republicans hold a significant advantage over Democrats on two top issues: the economy and immigration.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blue-state-gop-leader-reveals-who-benefiting-after-dems-clash-with-ice","Blue state GOP leader reveals who is benefiting after Dems clash with ICE","New Jersey GOP Executive Director Kennith Gonzalez says Democrats are putting too much focus on illegal immigrants over American citizens.
NEWARK, N.J. – A top Republican official in New Jersey told Fox News Digital that Democrats are putting greater focus on illegal immigrants as opposed to American citizens following Friday’s Delaney Hall incident.
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested during a protest last week in front of Delaney Hall, a privately operated Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, while Democratic Reps. Bonnie Coleman Watson, Robert Menendez Jr. and LaMonica McIver were visiting the detention center. Tensions rose significantly, which ultimately led to Baraka’s arrest, and now U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is investigating the incident. Baraka is slated to appear in court on Thursday for his trespassing charge.
""I think it's a very sad event, what happened, you know, the fact that Democrat Congress members, when Washington is in disarray, as well as the mayor of a city like Newark, which is nationally recognized for high crime, for violence, for so many things, that they would take time out of their days, out of their taxpayer-funded salaries, to come here and visit illegal immigrants when they should be focused on American citizens,"" New Jersey Republican State Committee Executive Director Kennith Gonzalez told Fox News Digital.

""It's very sad, but it is great for the Republican Party. Simply because the majority of voters here in New Jersey understand that the Democrat Party is not America first, is not New Jersey first, and we have an election this November,"" he added.
Immigration and border security was one of the top motivating issues for voters last November, and polling indicated support for deportation of illegal immigrants both before the election and into Trump's presidency.
""Last year, we saw President Trump come so close to victory here in New Jersey because the Hispanic community despised Joe Biden's border policies and his illegal immigration shenanigans, and they voted for President Trump because the Hispanic community, ourselves, wanted stronger borders. We wanted, you know, safer communities,"" he said.
Trump won nearly 46% of the vote in New Jersey in November despite it not being traditionally considered a swing state.

However, he said he would not be surprised if Baraka is the Democratic nominee for governor this November, given his recent arrest, which Democrats have said was the result of instigation from authorities, but federal officials maintain that he was not following the law. Meanwhile, Baraka has held firm in his stance.
""When the congressman came to the gate and was like, 'Mayor, they said they're going to arrest you.' That was a David moment,"" Baraka said Tuesday. ""I could have gotten in the car and ran. I could have said, 'I’m getting out of here, maybe they'll arrest me at work or at home or whatever.' But I froze. I froze – not even actively or deliberately – my body froze. My body – my body froze, like, 'This is it, you’re supposed to be here. Whatever they going to do, they going to do it.'""
Gonzalez said the ""theatrics"" may play well with primary voters, but it will likely not be appealing to a broader electorate.

""I wouldn't be surprised if they vote for him in the Democratic primary, and Ras Baraka is the candidate this November. But when it comes to the majority of New Jerseyans, including the Hispanic community, we understand. Illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in these United States do not deserve to be here,"" Gonzalez continued.
""Mayor Ras Baraka is a candidate for governor, and although it looks now that he's going to win the Democrat primary based on these liberal radical policies, the voters in November aren't going to buy him,"" he said.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/swing-state-judge-strikes-down-24-hour-abortion-waiting-period-unconstitutional","Swing state judge strikes down 24-hour abortion waiting period as unconstitutional","Pro-life activist and independent journalist David Daleiden of the Center for Medical Progress described his near-decade long legal fight with the state of California over his undercover video conversations with Planned Parenthood officials.
A Michigan judge ruled on Tuesday that the state's 24-hour waiting period and informed consent rules restricting abortion were unconstitutional.
The waiting period, which allows abortion-seekers to consider their options before the procedure, was voted into the state constitution by Michigan voters in 2022, before being challenged in a 2024 lawsuit filed by abortion rights groups.
""The mandatory delay exacerbates the burdens that patients experience seeking abortion care, including by increasing costs, prolonging wait times, increasing the risk that a patient will have to disclose their decision to others, and potentially forcing the patient to forgo a medication abortion for a more invasive procedure,"" state Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel wrote in her opinion.

Patel also ruled it was unconstitutional to ban nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives and physician assistants from performing abortions.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a post on X that she was ""overjoyed"" with the decision.
""I’m overjoyed to say that the Michigan Court of Claims has seen these restrictive provisions for what they are: an unconstitutional overreach that infringes on our constitutional right to make our own reproductive health decisions,"" Whitmer wrote. ""Today’s ruling reaffirms what we already know: reproductive health decisions belong between a patient and their doctor, not the government. I’m proud to know that this Women’s Health Week, we can celebrate by protecting and expanding women’s fundamental rights and freedoms.""

Michigan Catholic Conference President and CEO Paul Long said the intent of the proposal was to grant constitutional protections to ""an industry that places itself above the health and safety of women and the lives of pre-born children.""
""This decision is a tragic reminder that the normalization of abortion in Michigan exists to the detriment of some 31,000 children every year who will never have the opportunity to experience the gift and blessings of life,"" Long wrote in a statement. ""Now, more than ever, we encourage others to envision a world where human life at every stage – from conception to a natural end – is truly cherished and protected, where expecting mothers are supported with love and care and have access to maternal needs, regardless of the circumstance of the pregnancy.""

FIRST ON FOX: House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is opening an investigation into threats facing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, Fox News Digital was told.
It comes as fallout continues over three House Democrats accused of ""storming"" a detention center in New Jersey.
Fox News Digital was told that Jordan is expected to schedule a hearing for next Tuesday, with former ICE and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials expected among the witness panel.
The hearing will cover threats against ICE operations, likely including Delaney Hall Detention Center in Newark, New Jersey.

It's also expected to cover the Trump administration's advancements in cracking down on illegal immigration and threats to national security, Fox News Digital was told.
The hearing will likely be led not by Jordan's full committee, but by the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on oversight – a panel that's led by Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, where the Delaney Hall incident took place.
The planned move is a significant development in the situation led by one of President Donald Trump's closest allies in the House of Representatives.
Republicans have been discussing what, if any, consequences could be in store for the three Democratic lawmakers who protested Trump's immigration policies at the Newark ICE facility late last week.

Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., Rob Menendez, D-N.J., and LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., joined Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and other protesters outside the detention center, and apparently rushed in when the gates opened to let in a bus carrying detainees inside its walls.
Democrats have contended that they had a right to enter the facility as federal officials.
But Republicans, including DHS, have accused those Democrats of ""storming"" in and endangering both law enforcement and detainees in a bid to score political points.
Both sides have also accused the other of assault.

House Republicans are warning that consequences are in store for three Democratic colleagues the Trump administration accused of ""storming"" a detention facility in defense of illegal immigrants last week.
""Look, there's three possible disciplinary actions in Congress that the House can take,"" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters at his weekly press conference Wednesday.
He noted the House could censure, a symbolic rebuke with no further repercussions that requires a simple majority vote – a move Johnson said ""probably does seem appropriate here.""

Johnson noted the Republican majority could also boot them off their committees, or even expel those lawmakers – though he noted that required a significantly higher threshold.
""Now, expulsion requires a two-thirds vote. That's not likely with margins that are this small. But, you know, we're looking at what is appropriate,"" he said.
Meanwhile, other House Republicans who spoke with Fox News Digital called for a range of punishments, from censure to arrests.
""I really think there should be criminal charges filed against them,"" Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., told Fox News Digital, arguing there was no realistically sufficient punishment the House could levy.
""A censure doesn't do anything but raise them money, and no one here has the balls to expel anybody. Only Democrats' balls are that big.""

Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., however, said they should be ""censured, at the least.""
""The Justice Department should be looking at it. If there was any sort of battery or physical assault, that's just unacceptable,"" Stutzman said.
Both Republicans and Democrats have traded accusations of assault since last Friday, when three Democratic members of Congress joined Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and other protesters to rush into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, the Delaney Hall detention center, in northern New Jersey.
Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez argued they had every right to be there as federal officials on federal grounds and accused ICE agents of ""manhandling"" lawmakers who joined protesters that day.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused the Democrats of ""storming"" the facility after a bus carrying detainees went through its gates and said their actions put both law enforcement and detainees' safety at risk.
But Democrats are circling the wagons around the trio.

Rep. John McGuire, R-Va., said he was in favor of punishing those Democrats.
""We should be better than that,"" he said, without elaborating on what retribution was reasonable.
Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., introduced a resolution on Tuesday to strip the trio of their committees, which the three Democrats criticized.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's comments on her potential DOJ referral.
Trump administration ""border czar"" Tom Homan fired back at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., after she responded to questions Tuesday about the potential of being investigated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) for holding a webinar meant to help migrants deal with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.
When asked by Fox News Digital about Ocasio-Cortez saying she had yet to hear from DOJ or even know if she truly is under investigation, Homan said to check with the department itself.
The DOJ did not respond to an earlier related inquiry on the matter.
""I wish she'd do her job. She's a legislator, right? Why doesn’t she pass some legislation… and actually improve this country like President Donald Trump is already doing?"" Homan later added.

""I'm doing my job: the border is secure. We arrested three times more criminals than [former President Joe] Biden did. We're doing our job. She should try doing her job.""
Earlier, he answered in the affirmative when pressed on whether Democratic lawmakers who were accused of storming an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, should face consequences.
""Yes,"" he added when asked if they should face censure or removal of their committee assignments.
Another reporter followed up by asking about a specific warning from Ocasio-Cortez on the matter.
AOC SAYS DOJ WON'T RESPOND TO HER INQUIRY ON POTENTIAL PROBE
""You lay a finger on [New Jersey Congresswoman] Bonnie Watson Coleman or any of the representatives that were there – you lay a finger on them, and we’re going to have a problem,"" Ocasio-Cortez said on Instagram.
Homan was on Capitol Hill Wednesday at the invitation of Republican Study Committee Chairman August Pfluger, R-Texas, to speak with his large House GOP group about immigration and border security.
Three Democratic members of Congress from New Jersey – Coleman, Robert Menendez and LaMonica McIver – joined protesters and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka earlier this week outside the Delaney Hall detention center in Newark. Baraka was notably arrested at the site.
In response to that question about AOC's warning, Homan turned around and laughed loudly before quipping, ""I’m extremely intimidated.""

At the time of her first brush with Homan over the webinar, Ocasio-Cortez told a Queens town hall crowd, ""I’m using my free speech rights in order to advise people of their constitutional protections. To that I say: ‘Come for me, do I look like I care?’""
Homan said after the event, ""I'm working with the Department of Justice and finding out where is that line… So maybe AOC is going to be in trouble now.""
The Democratic trio, along with party leaders, have consistently argued that the lawmakers had a right to be at Delaney Hall as federal officials. Republicans, meanwhile, are mulling possible consequences.

(Credit: Nicholas Ballasy)
While Democrats have largely ridiculed President Donald Trump's decision to accept a $400 million jet from the Qatari royal family on behalf of the U.S. government, Republicans have raised national security concerns and admitted they have not been briefed on the details of the deal.
Fox News Digital asked Senate Republicans for their reaction to Trump deciding to accept the luxury Boeing jet from Qatar. While Trump continues his diplomatic trip through the Middle East, House Republicans are busy finalizing his ""big, beautiful bill"" at committee markups on Capitol Hill.
""I actually haven't paid attention to it,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said. ""I'm sorry to be so out of the loop on that. I've just been thinking about Medicaid and about what the House is sending over.""
And Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, another Trump ally, said she didn't know enough about the deal to comment on it when pressed by Fox News Digital.
DEMS CONDEMN TRUMP'S JET DEAL, CALL $400M GIFT 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

""I need to find out from the administration what exactly is going on,"" Ernst added.
TRUMP DEFENDS QATAR JUMBO JET OFFER AS TROUBLED BOEING FAILS TO DELIVER NEW AIR FORCE ONE FLEET
Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Eric Schmitt of Missouri also admitted they don't know the details of the deal.
However, Collins, a Republican with a willingness to buck the party on certain issues, seemed to align more with Democrats' reaction to the gift, saying she suspected there could be issues within the GIFT Act, which prohibits federal employees from accepting gifts from foreign governments.
Democrats have pointed to the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution as proof the Qatari gift is ""unconstitutional."" The emoluments clause states that no elected official should accept a gift from a foreign country without consent from Congress.
""My concern is his safety,"" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla, told Fox News Digital. ""Qatar supports Hamas. The Hamas leaders live in Qatar, so my concern is the safety of the president. How are we going to know that the plane is safe?""

The U.S. Department of Defense is expected to retrofit the Boeing 747-8 luxury jet to be used as Air Force One. Some Republicans still have national security concerns.
""Qatar has a relationship with China, a relationship with Hamas. That would scare me,"" Scott admitted.
But Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo, said a ""free plane"" sounds like a ""good deal for the government.""
The Trump administration has continued to defend Qatar's gift to the United States. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed it was not ""Trump's plane"" and that it was donated to the U.S. Air Force.

On Wednesday morning, Trump signed a series of agreements with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Doha, Qatar, which included a Qatari purchasing agreement for 160 American Boeing planes, defense agreements and a declaration of cooperation between the countries.
Trump defended his decision to accept the Qatari jet Tuesday, saying it would be ""stupid"" not to and emphasizing that he accepted it on behalf of the U.S. government, not himself.
""The Boeing 747 is being given to the United States Air Force/Department of Defense, NOT TO ME! It is a gift from a Nation, Qatar, that we have successfully defended for many years. It will be used by our Government as a temporary Air Force One, until such time as our new Boeings, which are very late on delivery, arrive. Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a country that wants to reward us for a job well done,"" Trump said on Truth Social Tuesday.

""This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump added.
The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment about plans to discuss the deal with Congress.

Democratic California Rep. Eric Swalwell warned Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem that he has a ""bullsh--- detector"" during a heated exchange about a photo of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran citizen who the Trump administration deported.
Swalwell was grilling Noem about a photo of Abrego Garcia’s hand that shows alleged MS-13 tattoos during a Homeland Security budget hearing in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.
""I want you to have credibility and I want you to be taken seriously. Is this doctored or is it not?"" Swalwell asked, referring to the photo that President Donald Trump shared on social media. Swalwell was asserting that the letters ""M,"" ""S"" and the numbers ""1"" and ""3"" above the tattoos were edited onto the photo.
Noem tried to respond, saying that the deportation of Abrego Garcia was based off an investigation, not a photo, but was interrupted by Swalwell.

""Madam Secretary, I have a seven-year-old, a six-year-old and a three-year-old,"" Swalwell said. ""I have a bulls--- detector. I'm just asking you, is this doctored or not?""
Noem replied that it was ""unbelievable"" that the lawmaker’s focus was on a photo and not on the importance of U.S. national security, before saying she had ""no knowledge"" of the photo in question.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/duffy-clashes-democrats-over-dei-funding-cuts-denies-air-traffic-controllers-let-go","Duffy clashes with Democrats over DEI funding cuts, denies air traffic controllers let go","Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy clashed with Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., Wednesday over slashing DEI, climate initiatives.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sparred with Democrats at a House Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, slamming Biden-era climate and social justice projects while also pushing back against claims 400 air traffic controllers have been let go.
Duffy said such initiatives sucked money from other projects, and he pointed to the 2023 Harvard Supreme Court decision that effectively ended affirmative action in college admissions as justification for scrapping them. He said such Biden-era policies inflated project costs without contributing to safety or infrastructure quality.
""Our department, over the course of the last hundred days, has saved taxpayers roughly $9.5 billion,"" Duffy said in his opening statement. ""Those savings include monies pulled from projects tied to social justice to climate requirements, also boondoggle projects, as well as bringing efficiencies to the department.""

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SAYS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM UPDATES WILL TAKE TIME, BUT NOT 'JEOPARDIZE SAFETY'
Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., took issue with the move and drew on personal experience to justify it.
""My late wife... had to walk two and a half miles to school every morning right past the White school, where the White kids had buses. That was social injustice,"" Clyburn said. ""Now all of a sudden we see this as wasteful government spending? I don't think so. I think this is a wise investment in a country that has challenges that we need all people involved in.""
Duffy, while praising Clyburn’s history and work as an elected official, clarified that he wasn’t attacking the broader concept of social justice, but rather specific policy conditions under the Biden administration.
""What I see with the climate and the social justice requirements in the projects that you so dearly want built, that it's adding costs on,"" Duffy said. ""It's costing more money. If we take out 5 to 10% climate or social justice, that’s money we don’t have for additional projects. And that’s my concern.""

CONGRESS MOVES TO ADDRESS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER CRISIS AS NEWARK MELTDOWN SPARKS ALARM
Duffy also clashed with Rep. Norma Torres, D-Calif., who claimed that 400 air traffic controllers have been let go, accusing the Trump administration of eroding national air travel safety and delaying infrastructure projects.
""The administration undermined [safety efforts] by offering deferred resignation to controllers, and at least 400 of them… were fired, resulting in delays to much-needed upgrades,"" Torres said.
Duffy sharply pushed back, calling her statement a ""falsehood"" and flatly denying the claim.
""We have not fired – haven’t let go – anyone,"" Duffy said. ""Air traffic controllers? You said we let 400 go. No one in air traffic control has been allowed to take a deferred resignation offer. Not one. Not 400. Zero.""
The hearing focused on reviewing the Transportation Department’s FY 2026 discretionary budget request of $26.7 billion, a 5.8% increase from FY 2025. He promised to reduce bureaucracy, eliminate inefficiencies and reallocate savings to infrastructure.
""Our budget carefully focuses taxpayer resources on items critical to our most fundamental mission of safety and investing in transportation infrastructure,"" Duffy said.

In terms of the recent outages at Newark Airport, he blamed them on missteps by the previous administration, citing an ill-planned transfer of airspace control from New York to Philadelphia.
""They didn’t test and make sure the lines were hardened… and they didn’t move the STARS system, which helps interpret radar,"" Duffy said.
""We’re working at lightning speed and pace to get this resolved,"" he said.
To ease pressure on the system, the FAA is also working with airlines to reduce flight volumes, he said.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, is proposing freezing undocumented adult enrollment in full-scope Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, a fact sheet the governor's office provided to Fox News Digital indicates.
The document notes that the proposed freeze would take effect ""no sooner than January 1, 2026,"" and would apply ""to new adult applicants over age 19."" People would not ""be kicked off their health care,"" according to the document.
It also notes that the Golden State governor is proposing a $100 per month premium for Medi-Cal enrollees 19 and up with ""unsatisfactory immigration status,"" which ""refers to people whose immigration status makes them ineligible for federally funded Medicaid, including people with lawful status and the undocumented"" — this would take effect Jan. 1, 2027, under the proposal.

""Trump’s pendulum swings on tariffs have slowed the economy and weakened state revenues by a staggering $16 billion,"" the document declares.

Newsom ""refuses to turn his back on hardworking Californians, especially when it comes to their basic health care needs,"" the release states.

Top House Democrats said Wednesday they will join Republicans in blocking a House-wide vote on impeaching President Donald Trump.
""I have said before from this podium, this is not the right approach we should be taking,"" House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said at his weekly press conference. ""I'll join members of the leadership team in voting to table that motion.""
Aguilar called the push by one lawmaker within his caucus a ""distraction"" from Democrats' messaging that Republicans are trying to gut Medicaid via Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" – a narrative the GOP has pushed back on.

Democrats are scrambling after Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., stood on the House floor Tuesday and invoked a maneuver that effectively forces House leaders to take up a piece of legislation within two House working days.
House Republican leadership has opted for a vote on Wednesday evening to table the measure, a procedural motion that, if successful, would block a House-wide vote on impeachment.
Thanedar acknowledged his colleagues' concerns about his move during his own press conference Wednesday morning, though he insisted it would not deter him.
""Even some Democrats call me a lunatic, just like the president has called me lunatic,"" the Michigan Democrat said.
""But they have never said, nobody has said to me, ‘Mr. Thanedar, the seven articles of impeachment that you presented to the U.S. Congress, they’re a piece of s---. They're not good. You missed it, missed the point. They are not legally right.' They didn't do that. No one says that.""
House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said leaders in his party are against the effort. (Fox News Digital)
However, Aguilar said hours later that it was not the right time to push an impeachment effort.
""This is such an impactful moment, and our colleagues are locking themselves in a room for 24 hours to protect and defend healthcare. We shouldn't be talking about this proposal that is not right, not timely,"" Aguilar said, referring to the House Energy & Commerce Committee's meeting on budget reconciliation, which has been ongoing since 2 p.m. Tuesday.
""This president is no stranger to impeachments, he's been impeached twice. Impeachment is a tool that can be used, but it takes weeks, months to do. Right now the issue of the day is, will hill Republicans stand up and support healthcare in this country?""
MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE
When reached for comment on Thanedar's push on Tuesday, White House spokesperson Liz Huston told Fox News Digital, ""Every action taken by President Trump and his administration is fully lawful and firmly rooted in the will of the American people. President Trump is doing exactly what he promised: securing our border, bringing in trillions of dollars in investment to America, and restoring common-sense leadership.""

""Meanwhile, Democrats are once again showing where their true priorities lie — siding with illegal immigrants over the safety, security, and well-being of hardworking American citizens. This desperate impeachment stunt is nothing more than a reckless political act that the American people see right through,"" the White House said.
No Republican is expected to vote to proceed with impeachment.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/milwaukee-judge-indicted-helping-immigrant-evade-ice-faces-up-to-6-years-in-prison","Milwaukee judge indicted for helping immigrant evade ICE faces up to 6 years in prison","Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., commends President Donald Trump tearing into America's nation builders in the Middle East and weighs in on a Wisconsin judge being indicted for hiding an illegal immigrant from ICE on 'The Ingraham Angle.'
A Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge arrested in April for allegedly helping a man evade immigration officers in her court could face up to six years in prison if convicted, according to an indictment handed down Tuesday by a federal grand jury.
Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested by FBI officials last month for allegedly ""knowingly"" helping an undocumented immigrant in her court evade ICE authorities and telling the officers in her court that they needed a warrant. She was indicted by a grand jury Tuesday federal charges of concealing a person from arrest and on obstruction of justice charges, under 18 U.S.C. Section 1505 and 18 U.S.C. Section 1071, respectively.
On Wednesday, Dugan's legal team filed a motion to dismiss the federal case against her. They argued that the government ""cannot prosecute Judge Dugan because she is entitled to judicial immunity for her official acts,"" and that ""the government has no basis in law to prosecute her.""
The indictment handed down by the grand jury one day prior accused Dugan of ""falsely"" telling federal officials in April that they needed a warrant to come into her court during a scheduled appearance by Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, an undocumented Mexican national who was in court on three misdemeanor battery charges.
Dugan told the officers to proceed to the chief judge's office to obtain a warrant, according to the criminal complaint, and she then escorted Flores-Ruiz through a side door to evade federal agents.

If found guilty of both charges, Dugan could face up to six years in prison and up to $350,000 in fines.
She will appear in court on Thursday and is expected to enter a plea of not guilty, as indicated by a statement from her legal team on Tuesday.
""Judge Hannah C. Dugan has committed herself to the rule of law and the principles of due process for her entire career as a lawyer and a judge,"" her lawyers said, adding that their client further ""asserts her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court.""

Dugan's arrest and criminal charges have become a political lightning rod at a time when the Trump administration has moved to take sweeping actions to crack down on its immigration enforcement priorities.
Her actions, while controversial, have also attracted an all-star legal defense team to argue in court on her behalf.
Last month, her defense team tapped former Bush-era solicitor general Paul Clemente to represent her.

Clemente, who was also on Trump's short list of Supreme Court nominees during his first term, is a well-respected litigator who has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court.
He is also not the only Bush-era powerhouse representing her in court. Steve Biskupic, a former U.S. attorney and a George W. Bush appointee, was tapped last month to head up the team, as first reported by Law.com. Others include Craig Mastantuono of Mastantuono Coffee & Thomas and Jason Luczak and Nicole Masnica of Gimbel, Reilly, Guerin & Brown.
Still, Dugan's actions have also sparked fierce backlash from Trump administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who have vowed to hold her accountable for her actions.

""She will be held accountable for that,"" Noem told Fox News in an interview Tuesday night. ""That was a great decision, coming forward, to recognize that nobody can facilitate breaking the law.
""We shouldn’t be able to allow that in this country, and we need to make sure that even judges are held accountable for their actions,"" she added.

""It is a program specifically to address the needs of low-income and minority families as it relates to heating and even air conditioning. Why, why, why, why and what is your rationale for eliminating that program specifically? Why, why, why?""

Kennedy attempted to respond, saying: ""I'm very committed to LIHEAP. My brother ran a ….""
""I don't care about your past,"" Watson Coleman said. ""I care about your functioning in this department and this administration, right now, in response to this question.""
""My time has expired,"" Kennedy responded.

""Well, then so has your legitimacy,"" Watson Coleman shot back. ""I yield back.""
Watson Coleman was grilling Kennedy in the House Appropriations subcommittee Wednesday morning regarding staff cuts to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which assists low-income families to power their homes.

Kennedy responded to her question after their five-minute exchange expired, explaining that the Trump administration's energy policies will lower costs across the board, including for low-income families.
""I'm very conscious of the importance of LIHEAP to poor people all across this country,"" Kennedy said. ""My brother ran a low-cost, nonprofit fuel company for most of his life that provides low-cost fuel in New England. I've had many, many people come up to me and said, ‘My life was saved because that.’ I talked about Buu Van Nygren, who's the president of the Navajo Nation, when I visited about three months ago, and he said cuts to LIHEAP will end up killing people. So I understand the importance of this.""
The Office of Management and Budget's rationale ""was that President Trump's energy policy is going to reduce dramatically the costs of energy in this country,"" he said. ""And if that happens, then LIHEAP is just another subsidy to the oil industry. If it doesn't happen, then Congress is welcome, and they should, appropriate the money for LIHEAP and I will spend it.""
MAHA MOMS CALL FOR ‘RIGOROUS TRANSPARENCY’ INTO HEALTH CONCERNS
Earlier in the pair's five-minute exchange, the New Jersey lawmaker accused the Trump administration of carrying out ""racist attacks.""

""Few things enrage me more than the racist attacks I see this administration carrying out by embarking on an ignorant crusade to rid the government of any programs that are working to improve the lives of Black Americans,"" she said, as she railed against the administration overhauling federal policies focused on diversity, equity and inclusion and critical race theory initiatives. ""The administration has moved to ban the words Black, race, bias, minority, oppression, prejudice, discrimination, disparity and racism.""
""Any grant application on federal programs that include these words had them immediately stripped,"" she claimed, adding that such policies worsens the health care system for Black Americans. ""It is painfully clear to me that this, in doing this, this administration that you work with and work for is attempting to legitimize racial discrimination. And that, sir, is a moral disgrace.""

Kennedy shot back that President Donald Trump shares the same vision for the nation as Martin Luther King Jr.
""Congressman, President Trump's vision of this country is the same as Martin Luther King's, that we should have a colorblind administration,"" he said. ""President Trump is deeply concerned about the maternal health crisis and the fact that Black mothers, are more likely to die in childbirth 2.6 times, 260% likely to die.""
Watson Coleman responded, ""I don't need this rhetoric about Donald Trump and the lie that he cares about me and Black people.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-faces-pressure-gop-eliminate-irans-nuclear-capabilities","Republicans urge Trump to follow through on his plan to dismantle Iran's nuclear capabilities","Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo weighs in as President Donald Trump begins a three-day Mideast trip in Saudi Arabia.
FIRST ON FOX: Congressional Republicans are urging President Donald Trump to remain committed to a hardline Iran strategy, calling for the complete dismantlement of the regime’s nuclear enrichment capabilities in a letter that drew wide support.
The U.S. ""cannot afford"" an agreement like the 2015 nuclear deal under then-President Barack Obama that ""buys time"" for Iran to quietly continue its nuclear program, the letter, signed by over 200 members of Congress, stated.
Iran must give up its uranium enrichment capacity entirely – even for energy purposes, the lawmakers wrote. Their letter was spearheaded by Sens. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and House Republican Study Committee Chair Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas. It is signed by every GOP senator except libertarian-minded Rand Paul, R-Ky., and 177 Republican House members.
""The scope and breadth of Iran’s nuclear buildout have made it impossible to verify any new deal that allows Iran to continue enriching uranium,"" the letter read. ""The regime must give up any capacity for enrichment.""
4TH ROUND OF US-IRAN TALKS ENDS AS TRUMP SET TO EMBARK ON HISTORIC MIDDLE EAST TOUR

The lawmakers praised Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) during his first term and his administration’s ""maximum pressure"" campaign.
""We cannot afford another agreement that enables Iran to play for time, as the JCPOA did,"" the letter stated. ""The Iranian regime should know that the administration has Congressional backing to ensure their ability to enrich uranium is permanently eliminated.""
""You and your administration have therefore correctly drawn a red line against a deal that allows Iran to retain any enrichment capacity,"" the letter said. ""As always, we stand ready to provide you and your administration whatever resources you need to advance American national security interests.""
When asked last week if Iran could have a civil enrichment program if it did not produce weapons-grade material that could be used in a bomb, Trump said, ""We haven’t made that decision yet.""
However, more recently, Special Envoy to the MIddle East Steve Witkoff seemed to draw a red line against the prospect – a departure from previous comments.
GOP SENATORS: CONGRESS SHOULD VOTE ON TRUMP'S POTENTIAL IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL

""An enrichment program can never exist in the state of Iran ever again,"" Witkoff said in an interview with Breitbart.
Last month, Witkoff suggested Iran may be allowed to enrich uranium to low levels.
""They do not need to enrich past 3.67 percent,"" Witkoff said. ""In some circumstances, they’re at 60 percent. In other circumstances, 20 percent. That cannot be. And you do not need to run – as they claim – a civil nuclear programme where you’re enriching past 3.67 percent,"" he said on Fox News.
Such a demand could complicate talks with Tehran, which has repeatedly asserted its right to a civil nuclear program.
Iranian and U.S. officials ended talks in Oman over the weekend on a positive note, despite seemingly remaining at odds over the issue.
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said Tuesday that talks had not delved into the matter yet, but Iran would be open to a temporary restriction on enrichment levels.
""For a limited period of time, we can accept a series of restrictions on the level and volume of enrichment,"" said Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi, according to Tassim news agency.""We have not yet gone into details about the level and volume of enrichment.""
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi said Saturday that enriching uranium was ""non-negotiable"" in any sort of deal.
""If the goal of the negotiations is to deprive Iran of its nuclear rights, I state clearly that Iran will not back down from any of its rights,"" Aragchi said, according to state media.

""Iran continues negotiations in good faith, and if the goal of these talks is to ensure the non-acquisition of nuclear weapons, an agreement is possible. However, if the aim is to limit Iran’s nuclear rights, Iran will never retreat from its rights.""
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Sunday added that calls to dismantle Tehran's nuclear facilities were ""unacceptable,"" and, ""Iran will not give up its peaceful nuclear rights under any circumstances and will not back down from its rights in the face of pressure.""

American leaders bear responsibility for vilifying police officers, following the death of a sheriff’s deputy who was ""mowed down by a bloodthirsty criminal"" in Cincinnati, according to Vice President JD Vance.
Vance said that supporting law enforcement requires both policy and moral leadership, while he remembered Hamilton County, Ohio, Special Deputy Larry Henderson during a law enforcement breakfast Wednesday at the vice president’s residence.
""Larry Henderson lost his life because he was doing his job and keeping people safe,"" Vance said Wednesday. ""And when I think about why that senseless crime happened, obviously you've got to place blame on the guy who committed the crime.""But I also think a lot of the blame falls on American leadership, who for too long, have made our police officers out to be enemies, instead of the great public servants that all of us know that they are,"" he said.
‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’: GOP SENATOR UNLEASHES BILL WITH SEVERE CONSEQUENCES FOR HARMING POLICE

A car hit Henderson while he directed traffic near the University of Cincinnati during a graduation ceremony on May 2.
Rodney Hinton faces charges of aggravated murder, and authorities claim he deliberately drove into Henderson after police officers shot and killed Hinton’s 18-year-old son May 1. Hinton’s son was allegedly armed and in the middle of fleeing the scene of a stolen vehicle investigation when he was shot.
Hinton pleaded not guilty to the charges Tuesday, and a judge set the trial date for February 2026.
Hinton ""intentionally murdered a retired deputy who was working special duty at a graduation just because he was a police officer,"" according to the Ohio Fraternal Order of Police President Jay McDonald.
Meanwhile, Vance reassured law enforcement officials at the breakfast that President Donald Trump backs them.
""So know from the president on down, this administration stands behind you guys,"" Vance said. ""We love you guys. We know that you're out there doing a good job for us. And I think that moral leadership matters just as much as the public policy. But from this administration, you're, of course, getting it both.""

Hamilton County Special Deputy Larry Henderson, right, died May 2, 2025, after a car ran over him. Authorities proceeded to charge Rodney Hinton, left, with aggravated murder.
Vance pointed to a recent executive order Trump signed in April that aims to bolster resources for law enforcement officers, and includes provisions that would provide legal resources for officers who ""unjustly"" encounter fees tied to their official duties, and said the Trump administration wants to implement reforms that make it easier for police officers to do their jobs.
""We want to make it harder for people to sue police officers when they're acting appropriately in the line of duty,"" Vance said. ""We want to make sure so that when you guys are out there keeping us safe and you’re of course worried about all the bad guys, you’re also not worried about bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., preventing you from doing the job that the American people need you to do.""

Henderson’s death has prompted lawmakers to initiate reform.
Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, introduced the Larry Henderson Act into the Senate Monday, which would require those found guilty of assaulting a federal law enforcement officer to serve at least a 20-year sentence. That is up from the one to eight years in prison currently in place.

President Donald Trump said he may travel to Turkey for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, as he doesn’t believe President Vladimir Putin would show if he isn’t there.
""I don’t know if he’s showing up,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""I know he would like me to be there. And that's a possibility.""
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Ankara for direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war, but it’s not yet clear if the Kremlin leader will show up.
Russia had proposed restarting direct peace talks, and Zelenskyy challenged Putin himself to show up. Russia has refused to confirm who’s attending the talks, while Zelenskyy has said he will only meet with Putin.

The president noted that he has a ""full day"" scheduled in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Thursday, and he’d planned on sending Secretary of State and interim national security advisor Marco Rubio.
But, he added, ""I don't know that [Putin] would be there if I'm not there. We're going to find out. Marco's going and Marco's been very effective.""
""If we could end the war, I'd be thinking about that. Now, tomorrow, we're all booked out, and you understand that, we're all set, UAE tomorrow, and so we have a very full situation. Now, that doesn't mean I wouldn't do it to save a lot of lives and come back.""

At the White House before heading on his Middle East trip, Trump told reporters: ""Don’t underestimate Thursday in Turkey.""
Special envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg are expected to join Rubio, in a glimmer of hope for negotiations that have seemingly stalled out in recent weeks.
Zelenskyy stressed it’s time for negotiations between principals.

(Credit: Nicholas Ballasy)
President Donald Trump's decision to accept a $400 million jet from the Qatari royal family has cast a shadow over his trip to the Middle East this week as Democrats have ridiculed the gift as ""unconstitutional.""
""Trump is literally trying to fly around on a plane from a foreign government while serving as president. That’s a violation of the Constitution. The Emoluments Clause wasn’t a suggestion. It’s the LAW,"" Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said Monday morning.
The Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution states that no elected official should accept a gift from a foreign country without consent from Congress. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., penned a letter to the Government Accountability Office on Sunday, formally calling for an ethics investigation into the gift as a violation of the clause.
""I don't know who needs to hear this, but NO, Donald Trump cannot accept a $400 million flying palace from the royal family of Qatar. Not only is this farcically corrupt, it is blatantly unconstitutional. Congress must not allow this over-the-top kleptocracy to proceed,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on Sunday as the news broke.

When asked by Fox News Digital if Trump should accept the $400 million Qatari jet, Democratic senators were unanimous in their condemnation, calling the deal ""smelly"" and ""risky"" to national security.
TRUMP SIGNS AGREEMENTS WITH QATAR ON DEFENSE AND BOEING PURCHASES
""We shouldn't do it,"" Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said, adding that, ""We can build our own planes for security.""
Even if the Boeing plane was built in the United States, accepting the Qatari jet is ""risky,"" according to Welch.
""It's smelly enough that he should come to Congress. It looks and feels an awful lot like an emolument, and he and his library will end up getting a personal benefit out of it,"" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., told Fox News Digital when asked if Trump's deal needed congressional approval.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., piled on the Trump criticism in a series of social media posts and even delivered a speech on the Senate floor, arguing Trump is ""willing to sell out our nation's security in exchange for billions in bribes, including a free luxury plane.""

""American foreign policy should never be for sale. With news that Qatar is gifting a $400 million plane to Trump, the White House’s corruption is becoming a bigger and bigger threat to our national security,"" Murphy said in a social media post.
However, the Trump administration has continued to defend Qatar's gift to the United States, as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed it was not ""Trump's plane,"" but it was donated to the U.S. Air Force.
On Wednesday morning, Trump signed a series of agreements with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Doha, Qatar, which included a Qatari purchasing agreement on 160 American Boeing planes, defense agreements and a declaration of cooperation between the countries.
Trump defended his decision to accept the Qatari jet on Tuesday, saying it would be ""stupid"" not to and emphasizing that he accepted it on behalf of the U.S. government, not himself.

""The Boeing 747 is being given to the United States Air Force/Department of Defense, NOT TO ME! It is a gift from a Nation, Qatar, that we have successfully defended for many years. It will be used by our Government as a temporary Air Force One, until such time as our new Boeings, which are very late on delivery, arrive.

EXCLUSIVE — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a roughly 214% increase in applications to join the U.S. Secret Service compared to the first few months of last year.
The number of submitted applications from Jan. 20 to May 1 of last year was approximately 7,000 compared to 22,000 applicants in 2025 under the Trump administration.
""For four long years, the previous administration demoralized and denied resources to our brave men and women in law enforcement, including in the Secret Service,"" a DHS spokesperson told Fox News Digital.
""Our country suffered the consequences of that disastrous approach. President Trump himself nearly lost his life because of it. Now, after reforming the Secret Service and providing it with the resources it needs to do its job, we are seeing an historic surge in applications. Americans naturally want to protect and serve. We simply have to let them.""

""I think the reality is that the Secret Service is returning to the core mission and the standards that made it great and that inspires a lot of really good people to want to be part of it,"" former Secret Service agent Tim Miller told Fox News Digital. ""I think now under the new director, they are trying to get back to having highly qualified people that are very mission focused.""
""I know when I got hired, I had been a U.S. Marine Corps officer and a police officer, it was a high standard to get hired. I think many now want to be one of the best of the best and the Secret Service is trying to get back to that gold standard.""

The Secret Service was responsible for protecting former President Donald Trump through two assassination attempts during his 2024 campaign. The first was at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, and the second at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sept. 15.
The agency, founded in June 1865, was originally tasked with exposing counterfeit U.S. currency under the Treasury Department, but began overseeing presidential protection shortly after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901.

The agreements involved a purchasing agreement by Qatar for Boeing aircraft, as well as letters of intent and ""joint cooperation"" between Qatar and the U.S. The emir also signed an intent agreement to purchase MQ-9 drone aircraft.
Al Thani said he had a ""great"" conversation with Trump prior to the signing ceremony on Wednesday, adding that the agreements have elevated the U.S.-Qatar relationship to ""another level.""
The deepening U.S. relationship with Qatar has drawn fresh scrutiny this week, both due to Trump's visit and amid reports that his administration may accept a free jet from the Qatari royal family to temporarily replace the current Air Force One.

U.S. relations with Doha have come a long way since 2017, when Trump accused Qatar of harboring terrorism: ""The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level,"" Trump said at the time.

From there, Qatar became a major non-NATO ally to the U.S. in 2022 under President Joe Biden and is home to Al Udeid Air Base, one of the U.S.'s largest Middle Eastern bases and a key hub for U.S. Central Command operations.
Qatar has been at the forefront of peace and hostage negotiations, especially in the war between Israel and Hamas. An Israeli delegation traveled to Doha on Tuesday to hash out a potential agreement on a hostage exchange and ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.
In March, weeks of negotiations led by U.S. and Qatari mediators led to the release of American George Glezmann, who had been imprisoned by the Taliban in Afghanistan for more than two years. Doha’s negotiators were also involved in the U.S.-Hamas deal to release the last living American hostage, Edan Alexander, on Monday.

Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo appears to be on his way to becoming the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor.
Cuomo currently holds a double-digit lead over second-place candidate Zohran Mamdani in a Marist College survey obtained by Politico. In the first round of ranked-choice voting, the former governor has 44% versus Mamdani’s 22%, a lead that appears to hold throughout all six rounds. The survey shows Cuomo’s lead over Mamdani ranging from 20-24% overall.

ANDREW CUOMO DENIED ALMOST $3 MILLION IN PUBLICLY MATCHING FUNDS FOR MAYORAL BID, CITES 'SOFTWARE ERROR'
Marist College found just two other Democrats in the crowded primary who were able to garner double-digit percentages: City Council speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander. In the survey, Adams was knocked out of the race in round four and Lander in the fifth. The rest of the candidates were in the single digits with just two of them making it out of the first round, and by round three, all five were out.
Despite his popularity in the Marist College poll, Cuomo’s campaign has faced several setbacks. The former governor has missed out on matching funds twice. In April, the New York City Campaign Finance Board (NYCCFB) indicated that at least 20% of Cuomo's required disclosures contained documentation errors related to contributions.
The NYCCFB also said that the Cuomo campaign failed to meet its required two-part threshold of total contributions, which must be at least 1,000 different individuals, and contributors, which must amount to at least $250,000, needed to obtain the publicly matched funds.
The Cuomo campaign blamed a ""technical software error"" for the denial.
""Our campaign has operated in full compliance with the campaign finance laws and rules, and everything on our website was reviewed and approved by our legal team in advance of publication - as I'm sure Scott Stringer, Justin Brannan and others did when they launched similar pages. We look forward to making that clear when we respond to the Board’s preliminary ruling and receiving the full matching funds to which the campaign is entitled,"" Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi told Fox News Digital.

CUOMO LANDS KEY ENDORSEMENT AS COMEBACK BID FOR NYC MAYOR HEATS UP
On Monday, the Cuomo campaign was docked over $622,000 in matching funds for allegedly coordinating with a super PAC, according to New York 1, marking another financial setback for the former governor’s campaign. However, the campaign was awarded $1.5 million in public matching funds.
""Our campaign's momentum continues unabated: today we receive $1.5 million on top of the over $3.5 million we have raised in 73 days and are gratified to have the broadest coalition of supporters, and lead in every poll with voters in every borough, gender, race and ethnicity,"" Azzopardi told Fox News Digital.
Cuomo’s opponents have also criticized him over his past controversies, including his 2021 resignation and handling of COVID-19. Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams has demanded that Cuomo ""answer"" questions about allegations surrounding COVID-related nursing home deaths. Mayor Adams said that the allegations should not ""be an automatic disqualification,"" but that those who lost loved ones want to know ""exactly what happened.""

Mayor Adams is running for re-election; however, he is doing so as an independent, not a Democrat. The Big Apple mayor won in the eighth round of voting in the 2021 election cycle.
""I’m in the race to the end. I’m not running on the Democratic line. It’s just not realistic to turn around my numbers and to run a good campaign (from) where we are right now,"" Adams told Politico in April.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-take-one-step-closer-banning-congressional-stock-trading","Rep. Alford to introduce congressional stock trading ban mirroring Senate's 'PELOSI Act'","Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on lawmakers attempting to ban congressional trading and more on ‘Special Report.’
FIRST ON FOX: Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., on Wednesday will introduce legislation that would ban congressional stock trading, serving as the House companion bill to Sen. Josh Hawley's, R-Mo., ""PELOSI Act"" in the Senate.
Alford's proposed bill would ban lawmakers and their spouses from holding, purchasing or selling individual stocks while in office, but it allows investments in diversified mutual funds, exchange-traded funds or U.S. Treasury bonds. If passed, current lawmakers would have 180 days to comply with the legislation. Likewise, newly elected lawmakers must achieve compliance within 180 days of entering office.
""As public servants, we should hold ourselves to a higher standard and avoid the mere appearance of corruption,"" Alford said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, too many members of Congress are engaging in suspicious stock trades based on non-public information to enrich themselves.""
""These gross violations of the public trust make clear: we must finally take action to ban members and their spouses from owning or selling individual stocks,"" he added.

Under the proposed legislation, lawmakers who continue to make wrongful transactions would be required to hand over any profits they made to the U.S. Treasury Department. The House or Senate ethics committees could also impose a fine on such lawmakers amounting to 10% of each wrongful transaction.

House Speaker Mike Johnson endorsed a stock trading ban on Wednesday, saying ""a few bad actors"" have ruined Americans' trust in lawmakers on the issue.
""You want me to tell you my honest opinion on that? I’m in favor of that, because I don’t think we should have any appearance of impropriety here,"" he told reporters during a press conference.
President Donald Trump himself endorsed the same ban for members of Congress in an interview with Time magazine last month.

""You'll sign it?"" the reporter pressed.
""Absolutely,"" Trump responded.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-says-doj-wont-respond-her-inquiry-potential-probe","AOC says DOJ 'won't respond' to her inquiry on potential probe","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., spoke to Fox News Digital about a February threat to have her placed under federal investigation.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Tuesday that she still has not been able to confirm whether she is under federal investigation for a ""Know Your Rights"" immigration webinar she held in February.
""I've asked them, they haven't responded to me, but you know, I was once again fully using the First Amendment to inform people of their constitutional rights. They say a lot of things, but I've written a formal letter, and they won't respond,"" Ocasio-Cortez told Fox News Digital.
When asked what the fallout might be from the potential arrest of a lawmaker by the Trump administration, Ocasio-Cortez said that detention ""without any actual grounds"" would be a ""tremendous sea change and escalation in what this administration is willing to do to bend laws, norms, et cetera, and how a normal functioning democracy works.""
Ocasio-Cortez also considered how America’s allies would think of an ""authoritarian development"" like the U.S. arresting one of its own sitting congress members.

""I sure hope that for all the saber-rattling that this administration is doing, that they really think about the global consequences of what it means for the United States,"" she said.
In February, Ocasio-Cortez dared Trump ""border czar"" Tom Homan to follow through on a suggestion he would refer her to the Justice Department for prosecution in response to essentially advising illegal immigrants on how to avoid deportation.
""I’m using my free speech rights in order to advise people of their constitutional protections. To that I say: Come for me, do I look like I care?"" she said at a town hall in Queens shortly after the webinar.
Homan said after the event, ""I'm working with the Department of Justice and finding out where is that line … So maybe AOC is going to be in trouble now.""
Homan told FOX Business that Ocasio-Cortez needed to read federal statutes and understand that entering the U.S. illegally is a deportable crime.

In her letter to Attorney General Pamela Bondi, Ocasio-Cortez asked for clarity on whether the DOJ has ""yielded to political pressure"" and weaponization attempts to confront elected officials they ""disagree with.""
""Tom Homan has gone on multiple forums threatening political prosecution against me, citing resources I distributed informing my constituents and the American public of their constitutional and legal rights,"" she said.
""On February 13, 2025, Mr. Homan announced that he had asked the deputy attorney general to open an investigation, and that I will be ‘in trouble now’… I am sure you aware of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution,"" the letter went on.
""Educating the public about their rights, especially in a time of rising uncertainty, is a key part of our responsibility as elected officials,"" she wrote.

""A government that uses threats of DOJ investigations to suppress free speech is a threat to all, regardless of political ideology.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pete-buttigieg-says-biden-running-again-maybe-mistake","Pete Buttigieg says Biden running again was 'maybe' a mistake","Former Biden Transportation Secy. Pete Buttigieg speaks with reporters after headlining a town hall with veterans in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which sparked more 2028 speculation.
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Pete Buttigieg, who served as Transportation secretary for four years in then-President Joe Biden's Cabinet, says that his former boss's decision to seek re-election in 2024 ""maybe"" hurt the Democrats.
Additionally, Buttigieg — whose trip to Iowa this week sparked further speculation that he is seriously considering a 2028 White House run — when asked if the Democratic Party would have been better off if Biden had ruled out running for a second term as president, acknowledged that ""with the benefit of hindsight, I think most people would agree that that’s the case.""
Buttigieg's comments — as he took questions from reporters after holding a large town hall with veterans and military families in this eastern Iowa city on Tuesday night — came amid excerpts from a new book titled, ""Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,"" which offer claims of a White House cover-up of the then-president's alleged cognitive decline.
Biden dropped out of the White House race last July, one month after a disastrous debate performance with now-President Donald Trump that sparked a chorus of calls from fellow Democrats for the then-81-year-old president to end his re-election bid. He was replaced at the top of the ticket by then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who ended up losing November's presidential election to Trump.

When asked whether Biden experienced cognitive decline, Buttigieg told reporters that ""every time I needed something from him from the West Wing, I got it.""
BIDEN AIDES ‘SCRIPTED’ EVERYTHING, ALLOWED HIS FACULTIES TO ‘ATROPHY,’ NEW BOOK CLAIMS
""The time I worked closest with him in his final year was around the Baltimore bridge collapse. And what I can tell you is that the same president the world saw addressing that was the president I was in the Oval with, insisting that we do a good job, do right by Baltimore. And that was characteristic of my experience with him,"" he added.

Buttigieg won the 2020 Iowa presidential caucuses and came in a close second in the New Hampshire presidential primary before Biden surged to claim the party's nomination and later the White House.
While Iowa's caucuses for half a century kicked off both major political parties' presidential nominating calendars, the Democratic National Committee demoted the Hawkeye State on their 2024 schedule, and it is unclear if Iowa will regain its early state status in the 2028 calendar.
WHAT BUTTIGIEG TOLD FOX NEWS — IN IOWA — ABOUT A POSSIBLE 2028 RUN
However, Buttigieg's visit, along with his announcement in March that he would pass on a 2026 run for a Democrat-controlled open Senate seat in battleground Michigan, his adopted home state, are seen as signals of his interest in a potential 2028 national run.
Buttigieg told a Substack author in a live interview hours before the town hall that when it comes to 2028, he would consider ""what I bring to the table.""

However, when asked by Fox News if the trip to Iowa — where he also gathered with staffers from his 2020 campaign and was followed around by a videographer from his political group Win the Era — was the beginning of an assessment period, Buttigieg said that ""right now, I’m not running for anything and part of what’s exciting and compelling about an opportunity like this is to be campaigning for values and for ideas rather than a specific electoral campaign. So that's what I'm about.""

When told about audience members who said they supported him in 2020 and would be interested in backing him again if he runs in 2028, Buttigieg said, ""Of course, it means a lot to hear that people who supported me then continue to believe in what I have to say.""
The Cedar Rapids event was hosted by VoteVets, a progressive group that represents veterans and military families in the political process. The group told Fox News that 1,800 people attended the event.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has ""lost his confidence"" and suggested that ""there’s something wrong"" with the New York Democrat.
Trump made the remarks while traveling to Qatar for the second leg of his Middle East trip when reporters aboard Air Force One asked about Schumer’s threats to block the president’s Justice Department political appointees until the senator gets answers about a jumbo jet gift from Qatar's royal family.
""Schumer is Schumer,"" Trump said. ""You know, he's become a Palestinian. Something wrong with him? I don't know, I've known him a long time and there's something wrong. He's lost his confidence, totally. And there's something wrong with him. I don't know what it is with Schumer.""
Schumer called the Qatari gift a ""grave national security threat"" on the Senate floor on Tuesday.

Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., breaks down the Trump administration’s foreign policy in the Middle East and the arrests at a New Jersey ICE detention center on ‘Fox News Sunday.’
Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla. — the first Democrat to join the Congressional DOGE caucus — pronounced the group ""dead"" while speaking to Politico.
""The DOGE caucus is dead. It’s defunct. We haven’t met in months. We only had two total meetings in five months. And we weren’t involved at all in anything [happening at DOGE], which Elon was in charge of. Zero. Zilch. Nada.

FIRST ON FOX: A government watchdog has uncovered that former President Joe Biden’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) spent tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars sending top officials to a conference in Scotland that included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) workshops.
The Functional Government Initiative (FGI), via a FOIA request, discovered that the Biden FDA spent an estimated $60,000 on a dozen staffers, including Senior Advisor for Health Equity Dr. Charlene Le Fauve, to attend the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco's (SRNT's) conference in Edinburgh, Scotland, in March 2024.
While at the conference, members of the team attended a workshop that focused on the ""stigma"" facing LGBTQ+ people in the field of tobacco research.
Topics included in that workshop, according to the FDA’s own report on the trip, included ""how anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and discriminatory and stigmatizing environments toward LGBTQ+ populations impact tobacco use and tobacco control research"" and ""process to develop a community-based participatory research project to address smoking cessation among transgender individuals in Argentina.""

Another topic discussed was ""the challenges of conducting research on tobacco use in the high-stigma environment of pregnancy in a post-Dobbs era.""
Le Fauve justified the trip, in part, by claiming ""the knowledge gained at the meeting is critical to attendees’ ability to understand emerging scientific issues that may impact their work and their ability to effectively move forward agency initiatives.""
""The formal SRNT conference included many sessions where health equity was an identified focus and I attended several which were highly relevant, well done, and informative including the Presidential Symposium that included three presenters supporting the premise that in order to have a global impact on the tobacco smoking pandemic, nicotine and tobacco research must broaden its vision beyond wealthy countries to include research and researchers in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the vast majority of the world’s people who smoke live,"" Le Fauve added.

Also present on the trip was Center for Tobacco Products Director Brian King, who was recently relieved of his duty by the Trump administration in a move that a former agency official told Fox News Digital was a result of the FDA straying from its core mission under the Biden administration and focusing on issues like DEI.
""There were many, many failures in the key core missions for the center that needed dramatic change in new leadership,"" David Oliveira, who recently left the FDA after six years, told Fox News Digital last month, explaining that the FDA was ceding responsibility to other departments and not doing enough to crackdown on China flooding the market with illicit vapes.
FGI Communications Director Roderick Law told Fox News Digital in a statement that spending tens of thousands of dollars to send a dozen employees to a conference in Scotland is another example of the agency losing focus on its mission.
""I, like anyone else in the world, would love to have a $60,000 vacation paid for by my employer,"" Law said.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/targeted-trump-well-known-democrat-sparks-2028-speculation-stop-key-state","Targeted by Trump, well-known Democrat sparks 2028 speculation with stop in key state","Former Biden Transportation Secy. Pete Buttigieg speaks with reporters after headlining a town hall with veterans in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which sparked more 2028 speculation.
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa – Pete Buttigieg returned Tuesday to Iowa, the state that boosted him from long shot to crucial contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
Buttigieg’s trip, where he headlined a town hall with veterans, is sure to fuel speculation that he is seriously eyeing a 2028 presidential run. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, 2020 White House contender and four-year Transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden, has remained a prominent figure in Democratic circles.
""It feels really good to be back in Iowa. Anyone can come to Iowa just before an election is coming up,"" Buttigieg said at the town hall, which was his first public political appearance since the end of the Biden administration.
Pointing to his 2020 caucus victory, Buttigieg elicited loud cheers, saying, ""I wanted to make sure I had a chance to talk with the people I got to know five or six years ago, and people I'm seeing for the very first time.""
LESS THAN FOUR WEEKS INTO TRUMP'S SECOND TERM, DEMOCRATS ALREADY EYEING 2028 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Buttigieg did not bring up 2028 in his comments and was not asked about a potential second White House run as he took questions from the audience at the town hall, which was hosted by VoteVets, a progressive political organization that works to lift veterans and military families. The group told Fox News that roughly 1,800 people packed the event.
Buttigieg told a Substack author in a live interview hours before the town hall that when it comes to 2028, he would consider ""what I bring to the table.""
During his 24 hours in the Hawkeye State, Buttigieg also gathered with staffers from his 2020 campaign and was followed around by a videographer from his political group Win the Era.
A WORKING LIST OF WHICH DEMOCRATS MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028
When asked by Fox News if the trip to Iowa was the beginning of a 2028 assessment period, Buttigieg said, ""right now, I’m not running for anything and part of what’s exciting and compelling about an opportunity like this is to be campaigning for values and for ideas rather than a specific electoral campaign. So that's what I'm about.""
A handful of those in the crowd interviewed by Fox News said they supported Buttigieg in the 2020 caucuses and would be interested in backing him again if he runs in 2028.

""I’m here because I come from a long line of veterans. I have three family members who are currently working at the VA hospital in Iowa City. So, I’m here to show support,"" said Faith Hunt of Cedar Rapids. ""I loved Pete in 2020, and I’m excited to see that he’s campaigning and hope to see that he runs again.""
Additionally, Chris Bzdill of Cedar Rapids said, ""I really liked to hear what he had to say…It’s a very refreshing change. It seems logical and straightforward."" He added, ""I'm kind of hoping that this progresses more, and we’ll see where it goes.""
Buttigieg, pointing to those comments, said, ""Of course it means a lot to hear that people who supported me then continue to believe in what I have to say.""
The trip by Buttigieg to Iowa comes less than four months into President Donald Trump's second tour of duty in the White House.
WHAT BUTTIGIEG SAID ABOUT BIDEN'S COGNITIVE ABILITIES DURING HIS FINAL YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE
It comes as the Democratic Party's favorable ratings in national polls have plummeted to all-time lows while an increasingly angry and energized party base is anxious to push back against Trump's sweeping and controversial moves during his second administration.
Democrats are already fixated on next year's midterm elections, when the party hopes to win back majorities in the House and possibly the Senate from the Republicans. Additionally, Democrats are also already looking ahead to the 2028 presidential campaign and for potential contenders to start making early moves.
While Iowa's caucuses for half a century kicked off both major political parties' presidential nominating calendars, the Democratic National Committee demoted the Hawkeye State on their 2024 schedule.

However, Buttigieg's visit, along with his announcement in March that he would pass on a 2026 run for a Democrat-controlled open Senate seat in battleground Michigan, his adopted home state, are seen as signals of his interest in a potential 2028 national run.
Buttigieg, who, unlike many other top Democrats, often appeared on the Fox News Channel during his four years in the Biden administration, has spent the opening months of the second Trump administration making TV appearances and also joining highly visible podcasts.
""We’re trying out several different formats — town halls, Q&As with different people on his social media, going out to podcasts and shows both political and non-political, and more — to try to reach people where they are, both in-person and online,"" Buttigieg adviser Chris Meagher told Fox News ahead of the event.
Buttigieg, during the town hall, noted that ""there are all these sources of information that our friends who think differently than we do about politics are getting information from, that, frankly, are not subject to the editorial standards of a newspaper. And that makes it all the more important to get in there and present a different way of looking things.""
Buttigieg is a veteran, having served six years in the Navy Reserves as an intelligence officer. During his time in the service, Buttigieg deployed for six months to the war in Afghanistan.
""This was not your typical Democratic rally because of the audience we were able to build and the messenger we had. These were center-right military families and veterans who want to come home to the Democratic Party, VoteVets spokesman Matt Corridoni told Fox News.
Pointing to Iowa, a one-time battleground state that has turned red over the past decade, Buttigieg acknowledged during the town hall that ""Democrats do not have the best brand around here.""
He told reporters that ""I think it’s really important to be in communities like this, to be in red states, to be in rural areas. It’s so important for Democrats to have a vocabulary to be able to reach out, and you can’t fashion that vocabulary online or only talking to people who already agree with you.""
Buttigieg heavily criticized the actions of the second Trump administration in his comments during the town hall, but he also emphasized that Democrats aiming to escape the political wilderness must spotlight their own ideas.
""There’s this theory that we should just hang back and let them screw up. I disagree,"" Buttigieg said.
WATCH: TRUMP TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY LAYS OUT NEW PLAN TO UPGRADE AGING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM
The trip by Buttigieg came as he has faced incoming fire in recent days from Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over a surge in flight delays and cancellations at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, which is one of the three major airports that services the New York City metropolitan area.
Duffy blames his predecessor at the Department of Transportation and the Biden administration for what he claims was a failure to upgrade the busy airport's air traffic control system.
Additionally, Trump, last week, also chimed in, claiming that during his tenure as Transportation secretary, Buttigieg ""didn’t have a clue. And this guy is actually a contender for president?""
Trump added, ""I don't think he's going to do too well.""
The president's jabs came a few days after Buttigieg, pointing to Trump's underwater approval ratings in national polling, said in a social media post that ""Donald Trump is the most unpopular 100-day-mark president in modern American history.""
The Trump administration argues that Buttigieg oversaw a rocky transition of the Newark airport's airspace to the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control (Tracon) last July.
Duffy, who earlier this week unveiled a major plan to overhaul the nation's aging air traffic control system, claims the Biden administration is to blame for the recent problems, including air traffic control equipment outages.
""Maybe when you work from home, or maybe when you work from Michigan as a secretary, maybe you’re not focused on the real issues that are taking place throughout the airspace,"" Duffy said, as he took aim at Buttigieg, who lives in Michigan.
Buttigieg, responding, told reporters that ""when you’re the secretary of transportation, you have a tough job and your responsibility is to fix tough problems. You don’t have time to indulge in trying to point fingers or blame other people.""

""What I can tell you is we inherited a shrinking air traffic control workforce. We turned it into a growing air traffic control workforce,"" he added. ""My successor is, of course, not asking for my advice, but my advice would be to making sure that it grows and actually delivering the technological change that’s needed.""
He added that ""we launched the contract to modernize the communications backbone of the FAA knowing that it wasn’t something that could be done in a year or two years. If he can achieve an acceleration of that, I will be the first one to be cheering for that. But that takes focus, it takes discipline, it takes integrity and, frankly, there’s no time for politics on a mission-critical job like that.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-moves-trumps-agenda-forward-all-night-committee-debate","House GOP moves Trump's agenda forward after all-night committee debate","Fox News Digital captured video of Capitol Police arresting protesters who disrupted the budget markup on Tuesday as Democrats continue to warn of Medicaid cuts. At one point, Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ, appears to cheer them on.
The House of Representatives' tax-writing panel took a key step in advancing President Donald Trump's tax agenda on Wednesday morning, finishing a marathon session that began with lawmakers entering a cavernous and chilly room in the Longworth House Office building just after 2 p.m. on Tuesday.
The House Ways & Means Committee advanced its portion of Trump's ""one big, beautiful bill,"" one of 11 committees working on the effort that will then be part of one massive piece of legislation.
It happened despite a barrage of protest amendments lobbed by Democratic lawmakers in a bid to slow proceedings down and make Republicans take politically tricky votes.
The Energy & Commerce Committee and the Ways & Means Committee both held meetings through the night to debate and advance key parts of Trump’s bill.

The former's meeting is expected to go into Wednesday afternoon after beginning Tuesday at 2 p.m. The Ways & Means Committee advanced its portion early on Wednesday morning in a party-line 26 to 19 vote.
As committee meetings stretched long through the night and next morning, Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., was caught snoozing during the Energy & Commerce's budget markup on Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, at the House Ways & Means Committee's markup, Rep. Blake Moore, R-Utah, had to be jolted awake to participate in a vote.
The House Agriculture Committee, another critical panel, began working on its portion on Tuesday evening and paused proceedings around midnight. That committee is expected to resume later Wednesday morning.
Democrats on each committee, meanwhile, have prepared a barrage of attacks and accusations against GOP lawmakers looking to gut critical welfare programs. The committee meetings have lasted hours because of left-wing lawmakers offering what seemed at times to be an endless stream of amendments that Republicans routinely shot down.
Sparks flew early at the Energy & Commerce Committee meeting with protesters both inside and outside the room repeatedly attempting to disrupt proceedings – with 26 people arrested by Capitol Police.
Protesters against Medicaid cuts, predominately in wheelchairs, remained outside the budget markup for several hours as representatives inside debated that and other critical facets under the committee’s broad jurisdiction.

Inside the budget markup, Democrats and Republicans sparred along party lines over Medicaid cuts. Democrats repeatedly claimed the Republican budget proposal will cut vital Medicaid services.
Many Democrats shared how Medicaid services have saved their constituents’ lives and argued that millions of Americans could lose coverage under the current proposal.
Meanwhile, Republicans accused Democrats of lying to the American people about Medicaid cuts – a word Kentucky Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, deterred his colleagues from using. Tensions arose when the word was repeated as Democrats called it a mischaracterization of their testimonies.
Republicans have contended that their bill only seeks to cut waste, fraud, and abuse of the Medicaid system, leaving more of its resources for vulnerable populations that truly need it.
That committee was tasked with finding $880 billion in spending cuts to offset Trump’s other funding priorities. Guthrie told House Republicans on a call Sunday night that they’d found upwards of $900 billion in cuts.
Democrats have seized on Republican reforms to Medicaid, including heightened work requirements and shifting more costs to certain states, as a political cudgel.
At one point late in the evening, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., made an appearance at the Energy & Commerce panel’s meeting.

""I just want to mention our Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries is here because of his concern about Medicaid. Thank you,"" the committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., said.
But tensions remain between moderate Republicans and conservatives about the level of cuts the committee is seeking to the former Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) green energy tax subsidies.
Several Democratic amendments were also offered throughout the night to preserve the green energy bill, but all were shot down.
By early Tuesday morning, the Energy & Commerce Committee had advanced portions of its bill, rolling back significant chunks of the IRA and setting standards for telecommunication – including a decade-long moratorium on state-level laws dealing with artificial intelligence (AI).
The meeting at the Ways & Means Committee had relatively little fanfare but was equally contentious as Democrats attempted to offer amendments to preserve Affordable Care Act tax credits, cap tax cuts for the wealthy, and changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap.
At one point, Reps. Beth Van Duyne, R-Texas, and Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., got into a heated exchange over SALT, with Suozzi pushing Van Duyne on whether she’d ever been to New York.
Van Duyne earlier called Texas a ""donor state"" in terms of taxes, arguing, ""We should not have to pay to make up for the rich folks in New York who are getting raped by their local and state governments.""
Suozzi later pointed out Van Duyne was born and went to college in upstate New York – leading to audible gasps in the room.
Van Duyne said there was ""a reason"" she left.
BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY
""We’re sorry you left New York, but in some ways it may have worked out better for all of us,"" Suozzi said.
The SALT deduction cap, however, is still a politically tricky issue even as House lawmakers debate what Republicans hoped would be the final bill.
The legislation would raise the $10,000 SALT deduction cap to $30,000 for most single and married tax filers – a figure that Republicans in higher cost-of-living areas said was not enough.
Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., threatened to vote against the final bill if the new cap remains.
As the committee’s marathon meeting continued, a group of blue state Republicans huddled with House GOP leaders to find a compromise on a way forward.
Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., hinted at tensions in the meeting when he posted on X that Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., a member of the SALT Caucus and Ways & Means Committee, ""wasn’t involved in today’s meeting"" because her district required ""something different than mine and the other most SALTY five.""
Malliotakis previously told Fox News Digital she was supportive of the $30,000 cap. She’s also the only member of the SALT Caucus on the critical tax-writing panel.
Rep. Beth Van Duyne got into a heated back-and-forth with Rep. Tom Suozzi.
As morning rose on House lawmakers, Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., quipped at the tax meeting, ""I see the light coming in from the East…I think it's going to be a Disney day.""
The Agriculture Committee, which began its meeting on Tuesday evening, saw Democrats waste no time in accusing Republicans of trying to gut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), colloquially known as food stamps.
Rep. Adam Gray, D-Calif., accused Republicans of worrying that ""somebody is getting a meal they didn’t deserve or kids are getting too fat"" instead of more critical issues.

Republicans, like Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, touted the bill’s inclusion of crop insurance for young farmers, increasing opportunity for export markets, and helping invest in national animal disaster centers aimed at preventing and mitigating livestock illness.
He also said Republicans were working to ""secure"" SNAP from waste and abuse.
House and Senate Republicans are working on Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in power to sideline the minority by lowering the Senate's threshold for passage to a simple majority, provided the legislation at hand deals with spending, taxes or the national debt.
Trump wants Republicans to use the maneuver for a sweeping bill on his tax, border, immigration, energy and defense priorities.
Two sources familiar with the plan said the House Budget Committee intends to advance the full bill, the first step to getting the legislation to a House-wide vote, on Friday.
Wednesday will be a critical day to see if that timeline holds. Eleven different House committees, seven of which have already finished their work, must each pass portions of the legislation before they're all fitted into a massive bill that must pass the House and Senate before getting to Trump's desk.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/qatars-rising-influence-trump-jet-offer-spotlights-foreign-foothold-washington","Trump visits Qatar as country's jet offer puts spotlight on nation's growing influence in Washington","President Donald Trump is greeted by Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani at the Qatar Royal Court.
The deepening U.S. relationship with Qatar is drawing fresh scrutiny this week as President Donald Trump began a Middle East tour amid reports that he may accept a free jet from the Qatari royal family to replace his current plane as Air Force One.
The prospect has drawn bipartisan pushback, which Trump has met with indifference.
""Qatar is not, in my opinion, a great ally. I mean, they support Hamas. So what I'm worried about is the safety of the president,"" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., told reporters on Tuesday.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told Fox News, ""I think it's not worth the appearance of impropriety.""

""[The Qataris] said to me, 'we would like to, in effect, we would like to make a gift. You've done so many things. and we'd like to make you a gift to the Defense Department,' which is where it's going. and I said, 'Well, that's nice.' Now, some people say, 'Oh, you shouldn't accept gifts for the country.' My attitude is, why wouldn't I accept the gift? We're giving to everybody else, why wouldn't I accept a gift?"" Trump explained to Fox News' Sean Hannity on Tuesdsay.
U.S. relations with Doha have come a long way since 2017, when Trump accused Qatar of harboring terrorism: ""The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level,"" Trump said at the time.
From there, Qatar became a major non-NATO ally to the U.S. in 2022 under President Biden and is home to Al Udeid Air Base, one of the U.S.’ largest Middle East bases and a key hub for U.S. Central Command operations.
Qatar has been at the forefront of peace and hostage negotiations, especially in the war between Israel and Hamas. An Israeli delegation traveled to Doha on Tuesday to hash out a potential agreement on a hostage exchange and ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.
""Qatar is an indispensable security and energy partner to the United States. It's a strategic partnership that has grown stronger and more expansive over time,"" Ali Al-Ansari, media attaché at the Qatari embassy, told Fox News Digital. ""His highness the Amir and President Trump have a longstanding relationship over many years, and both leaders have the shared goals of peace, security and stability.""
""Qatar is working closely with the president and his team to advance these shared goals, whether in Gaza, Ukraine, Congo or other areas of instability.""
TRUMP SAYS HE'LL DROP SANCTIONS ON SYRIA IN MOVE TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS

In March, weeks of negotiations led by U.S. and Qatari mediators led to the release of American George Glezmann, who had been imprisoned by the Taliban in Afghanistan for more than two years. Doha’s negotiators were also involved in the U.S.-Hamas deal to release the last living American hostage, Edan Alexander, on Monday.
""They’re very smart at making themselves useful,"" said Michael Makovsky, CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America.
The Trump Organization has cinched a new deal to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar, partnering with Qatari Diar, a real estate company backed by that country’s sovereign wealth fund.
""Their financial connections to people in Trump’s orbit, their making themselves useful as our mediators, communicating that strategically, the Qataris have been very effective at making themselves important,"" Makovsky added.
And despite its relatively small population – less than 3 million – Qatar controls over 10% of the world’s natural gas reserves.

""They have an enormous amount of influence as a result of the money they spend,"" said Jonathan Schanzer, executive director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
Energy Secretary Chris Wright praised Qatar as a ""valued energy partner"" – the second-largest producer of liquid natural gas in the world. ""I look forward to building on this new era of U.S.-Qatari relations together,"" he said. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has praised Qatar as a valued partner in negotiations.
Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kans., joined Trump officials in defending Qatar during a Senate hearing on campus antisemitism recently.
As a witness described links between the Qataris donating billions to universities and antisemitic protests, Marshall shot back: ""Qatar has been a great ally to America. So I don't know why you're attacking them.""
But others are skeptical.

""The Qataris have been sponsoring a wide range of terror groups for decades,"" said Schanzer. ""It's been a bipartisan decision to turn a blind eye to the problem.""
Israel supporters have long accused Qatar of funding Hamas. Prior to the outbreak of war after Oct. 7, 2023, Doha for years sent millions of dollars per month to the Gaza Strip to prop up Hamas’ governing structure there.
They’ve also spent billions in the U.S., including an aggressive lobbying operation in Washington.
""We have seen them invest billions of dollars into higher education. We know that they're investing in K-12 education in this country,"" said Schanzer. ""They're buying up parcels of valuable real estate. They are … spending massive amounts of money in states like Texas and South Carolina, where you have the defense industry and the energy industry.""
""Over the last two decades or so they have spent a lot of money, expended a lot of effort, and it's now paying dividends.""

Schanzer said he was pleased the discussion over the Boeing plane had spurred a national conversation over Qatar’s influence in the U.S.
""This is a longstanding problem that has gone unaddressed by Barack Obama, by Joe Biden, by George W. Bush and by Trump.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-asks-syria-join-abraham-accords-normalize-ties-israel-return-sanctions-relief","Trump asks Syria to join Abraham Accords, normalize ties with Israel in return for sanctions relief","President Donald Trump announced he will lift ""brutal and crippling"" sanctions on Syria, implemented under ousted President Bashar al-Assad.
President Donald Trump asked Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa to fully normalize relations with Israel in exchange for sanctions relief.
In a readout of the pivotal Wednesday meeting for Syria, Trump encouraged al-Sharaa to sign onto the Abraham Accords with Israel, tell all foreign terrorists to leave Syria, deport ""Palestinian terrorists,"" help the U.S. prevent the resurgence of ISIS and assume charge of ISIS detention centers in northeast Syria.
Some 10,000 ISIS fighters are imprisoned in the region, where the U.S.-backed Kurdish militia, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, is charged with keeping them locked up.
The U.S. has about 1,400 troops stationed in Syria to fight ISIS.
Trump said Tuesday it was a ""dream"" for Saudi Arabia to join the accords, but predicted Riyadh would do so in its own time. The kingdom has long insisted it would not do so until there was a path for Palestinian statehood.
Trump announced Tuesday he would lift sanctions on Syria and meet with its new leader, who once had a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head.

""In Syria, which has seen so much misery and death, there is a new government that we must all hope will succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace,"" he said. ""So I say good luck, Syria.""
Al-Sharaa and his group known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham led Bashar al-Assad’s ouster last year. His group was founded as an al Qaeda offshoot, before separating from the terrorist group in 2016.
The breakthrough announcement came as Trump is traveling to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, whose government leaders were widely expected to press Trump to release the sanctions to help Syria's economy.
""There is a new government that will hopefully succeed,"" Trump said of Syria. ""I say good luck, Syria. Show us something special.""

As the Trump administration speeds past the 100-day mark, various conflicts around the globe are in a much different place than when the president took office.
It has been nearly 600 days since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Not only did the act of terrorism launch a full-scale war in the Middle East, but it also facilitated a chaotic wave of pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli clashes at home.
""We're guided by two principles that are guiding our approach to this conflict. The first is that we stand with Israel and Israel's right to defend itself. And the second is that Hamas must release the hostages,"" U.S. Department of State Deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott told Fox News Digital. ""Those are the two guiding principles. And then we're looking at the long-term here in terms of what this is going to look like as a long-term solution to this conflict. Hamas cannot continue to exist.""
A New York Times opinion article ran last week, titled ""This Israeli Government Is Not Our Ally,"" just days before nearly 80 students were arrested during pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University in New York, illustrating that the strains between the two groups remain and the rise in antisemitism is still rampant.
""When it comes to some of these protests, and I use that word even somewhat lightly in terms of I don't even know if that's the best way to describe them, the secretary has been clear, the president has been clear, there's going to be zero tolerance for people that are here on visas that break our laws, that support or promote terrorism in the United States,"" Pigott added.

""When you're looking at that visa process, again, speaking from the State Department's perspective, there's a vetting process to enter the United States for a visa,"" Pigott explained. ""We're constantly monitoring the fact of, are you actually abiding by that visa? Are you [a student] doing things that are breaking our laws? And if you do, your visa may be revoked.""
Overseas, Hamas freed the last living American hostage, Edan Alexander, reportedly to appease President Donald Trump.
Israel issued an evacuation warning for Yemeni ports after bombing the nation’s main airport last week.
While the U.S. and the Houthis reached ceasefire agreements, Israel continues to punch back. Pigott made clear that the U.S.’ past and future decisions to attack the Houthis are heavily dependent on Islamist organizations' actions.

""The president's been clear, the secretary has been clear that the bombing that we saw was about freedom of navigation, protecting American interests, making sure we can have ships going through that area,"" Pigott explained. ""The Houthis have capitulated, but this is about their actions.""
Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s role as head of the agency got even more complicated after Mike Waltz left the National Security Administration (NSA) to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, and Trump assigned Rubio to fill the role.
Despite the increase in workload and responsibility, the State Department's deputy spokesperson says ""the results speak for themselves.""

""Of that collaboration, of the fact that President Trump has that vision, is involved with the policy, is saying, we need to accomplish this, and Secretary Rubio helping to implement that vision,"" Pigott added.
""These are men and women that are dedicated on delivering results for the American people. I mean, this past 100-plus days have been the most successful 100 days, I would argue, in history from a president.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-defeats-incumbent-republican-omaha-mayor","Democrat defeats incumbent Republican Omaha mayor","House GOP Rep. Mike Flood was confronted by protesters during a town hall in Nebraska on Tuesday night.
Democrat challenger John Ewing defeated incumbent Republican Omaha mayor Jean Stothert in a victory that the Democratic Party is describing as an indictment against the Trump administration and the GOP.
Ewing, who is currently the treasurer of Douglas County, will make history by becoming the first Black mayor of Nebraska’s largest city, while Stothert was denied a fourth term.
""I called John Ewing and I congratulated him. John Ewing is inheriting tonight a great city, and we leave a strong foundation for the city that we all love. We are proud, are grateful and we are hopeful,"" Stothert said in her concession speech.
The race between Stothert and Ewing primarily revolved around local issues like street repairs and garbage service, but in the final stretch the campaign touched on more national, hot-button issues such as President Donald Trump's administration and transgender rights.

Although the mayor's office is nonpartisan, the candidates made it clear to voters that Stothert is a Republican and Ewing is a Democrat.
One Stothert TV ad said ""Ewing stands with radicals who want to allow boys in girls’ sports,"" according to the Associated Press.
Meanwhile, Ewing aired ads that connect Stothert to the Trump administration, showing the mayor on a split screen with Trump and saying ""Let's say no to the chaos and elect a mayor who will actually get things done.""
In the latest results from WOWT, Ewing was leading Stothert in the vote count by 48,693 to 37,758.

The Democratic Party said with Ewing’s win, ""Democrats further extend a significant streak of overperformances and victories in elections in 2025.
""From the school board to city council, and now to the mayor’s office, Nebraska voters are making their message heard loud and clear: They want strong Democratic leaders who will fight for them, protect their rights, and build opportunities within their communities. As Trump and his MAGA Republican allies continue to fail working families at every turn, voters are channeling their frustration into action at the voting booth,"" the Democratic Party said in a statement.

""After tonight, vulnerable House Republicans like Don Bacon are on notice,"" added DNC Chair Ken Martin. ""Voters are sick of cowardly Republicans willing to bend the knee to Trump at their expense. They want true leaders who will govern on behalf of working families and not billionaire donors, which is why Democrats like John Ewing Jr. are winning elections up and down the ballot.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-house-bill-would-make-trump-ban-transgender-troops-permanent","New House bill would make Trump ban on transgender troops permanent","Jayme Franklin, founder and CEO of The Conservateur, reacts to Senate Democrats reintroducing a bill to make gender identity a federally protected characteristic.
FIRST ON FOX: A new House GOP bill would make President Donald Trump's executive order banning transgender troops in the military a permanent federal policy.
Rep. Barry Moore, R-Ala., is introducing the legislation this week and told Fox News Digital that his office has been in contact with the Trump administration on the measure.
""What we had with this trans movement was we had a bunch of people coming in, signing a six-year contract, and then starting the surgeries and starting the hormone replacements … they weren't fit for service, so they spent four or five years on the taxpayer's dime getting these surgeries and these chemicals and all this stuff, and then by the time they could really actually serve, they were ready to get out,"" Moore told Fox News Digital.
He said the bill would benefit both taxpayers in funding the military and overall recruitment to the armed forces.

""I think in many ways the taxpayers get a much bigger bang for their buck, No. 1,"" said Moore, a veteran. ""And No. 2, I think that if I'm looking at joining, these guys are really focused on fighting, and if I'm in the foxhole with these guys, these are people I've trained with, they're capable. You've got to have that on a battlefield.""
A source familiar with his office's discussions with the administration showed Fox News Digital an email that suggested tacit approval of the bill from the White House Office of Management and Budget, Pentagon, Department of Homeland Security and National Security Council.
The bill is titled the Readiness Over Wokeness Act, according to draft legislation previewed by Fox News Digital.
The text said the bill would ""prohibit individuals with gender dysphoria from serving as members of the Armed Forces.""
It would enact a similar ban on people with ""a history of gender-affirming care including cross-sex hormone therapy or sex reassignment or genital reconstruction surgery as treatment for gender dysphoria or in pursuit of a sex transition.""

Trump signed an executive order banning transgender people from serving in the U.S. military shortly after he was sworn in for his second term.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth followed suit by enacting the order, including discharging current transgender personnel.
The ban was challenged in court but recently upheld by the Supreme Court this month in a decisive victory for Trump.
""No More Trans [at the Defense Department],"" Hegseth wrote on X soon after the order came down.

Trump instituted a similar policy during his first term, though it was later reversed by former President Joe Biden.
But it would be much harder for a future Democrat administration to reverse Moore's bill if it passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by Trump.

A House Democrat plans to introduce a resolution calling for the U.S. to spend trillions of dollars on reparations for Black Americans this week.
Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., plans to introduce the Reparations Now Resolution on Thursday. Lee met with other lawmakers and activists on Capitol Hill on Tuesday at an event titled ""Why We Can’t Wait: Advancing Reparative Justice in Our Lifetime."" She argues that reparations are a ""moral and legal obligation"" for Americans.
""This is a moment in time where societies are shaped [and] new societies are built. We should be the ones who are shaping it,"" said Lee.
""Their real intention is to build up whatever comes next in their image,"" she said, referring to the Trump administration, ""and we better fight like hell to make sure that we’re building it in our image.""
Lee added that ""it took nothing but a stroke of a pen,"" for President Donald Trump to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government.

""That’s why we recognize that the fight to restore Black folks has to be so much more substantive,"" she added.
Lee's resolution cites U.S. slavery, Jim Crow laws, and other racially discriminatory laws and policies to justify spending trillions of dollars supporting the descendants of Black Americans in the U.S.

Lee's push comes after Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., introduced her own legislation in February calling for a federal commission to study U.S. slavery and reparation proposals.
""We are in a moment of anti-Blackness on steroids and we refuse to be silent,"" Pressley said at the time. ""We will not back down in our pursuit of racial justice.""

The bill aims to create a federal commission charged with investigating the enduring impacts of slavery and its aftermath, along with developing concrete proposals for reparations to African Americans who are descendants of slaves, Pressley said.
Democratic politicians in blue states, including California, in recent years have floated reparations as a way to atone for what proponents describe as a legacy of racist policies that created disparities for Black people in housing, education and health.

As the post has been inundated with backlash, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., was among those who weighed in.
""Americans got off the sidelines and handed us the majority in November. It’s the House GOP that is not passing President Trump’s executive orders, making DOGE cuts permanent, and hasn’t completed the big beautiful bill. Getting ratioed in comments is how Americans feel,"" Greene wrote.

President Donald Trump met with Syria’s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Riyadh on Wednesday, a day after lifting all sanctions on Syria, marking a major shift in policy.
The last time a meeting between the two countries' leadership was with former President Bill Clinton in 2000.
Trump met with al-Sharaa for an informal chat on the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council, where he was set to address leaders as part of his four-day regional tour.

Trump stated at the summit this was a step toward peace and rebuilding relations with Syria’s government.
""We are currently exploring normalizing relations with Syria’s new government, as you know, beginning with my meeting with President Ahmed Al-Shara and Secretary Rubio's meeting with the Syrian Foreign Minister in Turkey after discussing the situation with Crown Prince Mohammed,"" Trump said at the broader summit.

There is something deeply fascinating about Hill Republicans (sometimes stammering) and media conservatives (sometimes shouting) ripping President Trump for accepting a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar.
But he’s not the only president in trouble. More on that in a moment.
Daily Wire founder Ben Shapiro called the deal ""skeezy,"" saying the gift isn’t coming ""out of the goodness of their sweet little hearts…'It's an equal opportunity influencer – as long as you can help whitewash their image or smooth over the fact that they are in fact the world's largest proponents of terrorism on an international scale.""
FREE RIDE: ALLIES, EVEN LAURA LOOMER, TURN ON PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR ACCEPTING LUXURY JET FROM QATAR

National Review, under the headline ""Poison Plane,"" said in an editorial:
""For one thing, the plane is a potential security threat, given all of the possible places to hide listening devices within a jumbo jet. Assuming that issue could be dealt with through an extensive security sweep, there are the ethical concerns…
""Making matters worse is that Qatar is no friend. Its government funds Al Jazeera, the anti-American propaganda channel. It funneled billions of dollars to Hamas, helping the terrorist group build up the infrastructure that allowed it to carry out the October 7 attacks. After the attacks, Qatar issued a statement calling ‘Israel alone responsible’ for the massacre…
""There is absolutely nothing good that can come of an American president feeling he owes something to this terrorist-loving government.""
Veteran conservative radio host Erick Erickson points out that Attorney General Pam Bondi was a lobbyist for Qatar, paid $119,000 a month:  ""I don’t think that we should agree with Pam Bondi saying, ‘Oh, yes, Qatar can gift this to the Department of Defense on condition it goes to the Trump Presidential Library.’""
And uber-Trump defender Laura Loomer called the deal a ""stain"" on his presidency.
But the president isn’t backing down, saying he would have to be ""stupid"" to pass up saving big bucks by accepting the gift.""
BIDEN AIDES ALLEGEDLY FRETTED THEN-PRESIDENT WOULD NEED WHEELCHAIR IF RE-ELECTED, NEW BOOK REVEALS
Now to the former president.
A new book out today, by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, unearths devastating new material about the coverup of Joe Biden’s declining health.
Now we’ve all known since the disastrous debate against Trump that Biden’s mental acuity had dramatically dropped, and this is the main reason he was sequestered from the press and even from much of his own staff.
But in a piece on Axios – wonder how it obtained an advance copy of the book – the authors reveal some stunning news:
""Joe Biden's physical deterioration was so severe in 2023 and 2024 that advisers privately discussed the possibility he'd need to use a wheelchair if he won re-election.""
In ""Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,"" the authors cite ""the significant degeneration of his spine — and his aides' alarm over it as Biden sought a second term at age 81.""
Former President Biden's condition reportedly deteriorated to the point where wheelchair use during his prospective second term wasn't out of the question. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
The book also reveals ""the White House's determination to conceal the reality of Biden's condition, at the risk of his own health, while he faced a tough reelection bid against Donald Trump.""
Think about that for a second. While Trump has used poor judgment in accepting the Qatar plane, this is far worse. Yes, FDR was in a wheelchair, but the press agreed never to show him that way – that ain’t happening today. And he wasn’t 81.
GEORGE CLOONEY WAS 'SHAKEN' WHEN BIDEN FAILED TO RECOGNIZE HIM AT STAR STUDDED FUNDRAISER: AUTHORS
In the Guardian, which also got the book in advance, these on-the-record quotes from top Harris adviser David Plouffe – that the campaign was an F---ing nightmare, that Biden F----d us, he totally F----d us – hey, I’m just quoting here – shows the depth of intense anger at the former president for running again. And they’re furious that he’s doing a rehab tour on The View and BBC. They want him to get off the stage – hopefully not tripping – and stay there.
Biden aides believed it was politically untenable to have Biden use a wheelchair amid his re-election campaign. Of course they did. It would be political suicide.

His White House doctor Kevin O'Connor, pleading for more rest time, would tell the staff, ""I’m trying to keep him alive, and you’re trying to kill him.""
O’Connor ""privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,"" the authors report. One fall away.

Biden didn’t even recognize George Clooney, who had raised a record-breaking sum for him, and had to be prompted on who he was. Then Clooney wrote the New York Times op-ed urging Biden to drop out. The rest, as they say, is history.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday called out members of Congress for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers during a heated altercation outside a Newark immigration detention center last week.
Noem criticized the lawmakers for defending their actions as a supposed ""oversight."" Appearing on ‘Jesse Watters Prime,’ Noem accused the lawmakers of committing criminal behavior.
""This wasn't oversight. This was committing felonies. This was going out and attacking people who stand up for the rule of law. And it was absolutely horrible,"" Noem said.

McIver said the three lawmakers had waited more than two hours to gain access to the facility to conduct an oversight visit. She said all three of them were also assaulted by ICE personnel.
""There are people who are supposed to be officers, who are supposed to protect us, and they have done none of that,"" McIver told reporters. ""If they can treat three members of Congress like that, just imagine how they can treat people on the street each and every day, both undocumented and people who are citizens here in this country.""

McIver doubled down in a post on X, saying that ""none of this had to happen.""
""We arrived at Delaney Hall to do our jobs — period,"" she wrote. ""Instead of facilitating congressional oversight, as they are obligated to do, ICE created chaos.""

President Donald Trump continued to defend his decision to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar during an exclusive interview with Sean Hannity on Air Force One on Tuesday.
Trump has received backlash for planning to accept the jumbo Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari royal family since news of the gift broke on Sunday.
""Now, some people say, 'oh, you shouldn't accept gifts for the country.' My attitude is, why wouldn't I accept the gift? We're giving to everybody else? Why wouldn't I accept the gift?"" the president said to Hannity.

The luxury jet, which was offered to the United States because of delays in Boeing's production of the new Air Force One fleet, will serve as a temporary method of transportation so that the current presidential plane doesn't have to be flown.
Trump has said AF1 is nearly 40 years old and looks ""much less impressive"" when compared to the planes in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar.
""You know, we're the United States of America. I believe that we should have the most impressive plane,"" Trump told Hannity.
TRUMP CLARIFIES OWNERSHIP OF AIRCRAFT IN DEFENSE OF QATAR'S GIFT
In addition to Boeing running behind on delivering the new fleet, the jumbo jet is a gift to the Department of Defense for ""a job well done"" in successfully defending Qatar ""for many years,"" Trump added on Truth Social a few hours after the interview.
""Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a country that wants to reward us for a job well done,"" he wrote.
Trump has said the plane will be retired to the presidential library once Boeing delivers its new AF1 fleet.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-says-right-now-im-not-running-anything-during-iowa-stop","Buttigieg says 'right now I’m not running for anything' during Iowa stop","Former Biden Transportation Secy. Pete Buttigieg speaks with reporters after headlining a town hall with veterans in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which sparked more 2028 speculation.
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa – Pete Buttigieg pushed back against criticism from President Donald Trump on the job he did as transportation secretary in former President Biden's administration and declined to say if Biden experienced cognitive decline during his final years in the White House, as he took questions from reporters on Tuesday night.
Buttigieg, speaking with reporters after headlining a town hall with veterans in this eastern Iowa city that sparked more speculation that the 2020 Democratic presidential contender is mulling another White House run in 2028, told Fox News that 'right now I’m not running for anything.""
Buttigieg won the 2020 Iowa presidential caucuses and came in a close second in the New Hampshire presidential primary before Biden surged to claim the party's nomination and later the White House.
While Iowa's caucuses for half a century kicked off both major political parties' presidential nominating calendars, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) demoted the Hawkeye State on their 2024 schedule, and it's unclear if Iowa will regain its early state status in the 2028 calendar.
LESS THAN FOUR WEEKS INTO TRUMP'S SECOND TERM, DEMOCRATS ALREADY EYEING 2028 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

But Buttigieg's visit, along with his announcement in March that he would pass on a 2026 run for a Democrat-controlled open Senate seat in battleground Michigan, his adopted home state, are seen as signals of his interest in a potential 2028 national run.
Buttigieg told a Substack author in a live interview hours before the town hall that when it comes to 2028, he would consider ""what I bring to the table.""
But asked by Fox News if the trip to Iowa - where he also gathered with staffers from his 2020 campaign and was followed around by a videographer from his political group Win the Era - was the beginning of an assessment period, Buttigieg said ""right now, I’m not running for anything and part of what’s exciting and compelling about an opportunity like this is to be campaigning for values and for ideas rather than a specific electoral campaign. So that's what I'm about.""
Told that audience members who said they supported him in 2020 and would be interested in backing him again if he runs in 2028, Buttigieg said ""of course it means a lot to hear that people who supported me then continue to believe in what I have to say.""
The Cedar Rapids event was hosted by VoteVets, a progressive group that represents veterans and military families in the political process. The group told Fox News that 1,800 people attended the event.
WATCH: TRUMP TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY LAYS OUT NEW PLAN TO UPGRADE AGING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM
The trip by Buttigieg came as he's faced incoming fire in recent days from Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over a surge in flight delays and cancellations at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, which is one of the three major airports that services the New York City metropolitan area.
Duffy blames his predecessor at the Department of Transportation and the Biden administration for what he claims was a failure to upgrade the busy airport's air traffic control system.
And Trump, last week, also chimed in, claiming that during his tenure as transportation secretary Buttigieg ""didn’t have a clue. And this guy is actually a contender for president?"" Trump added. ""I don't think he's going to do too well.""
The president's jabs came a few days after Buttigieg, pointing to Trump's underwater approval ratings in national polling, said in a social media post that ""Donald Trump is the most unpopular 100-day-mark president in modern American history.""
The Trump administration argues that Buttigieg oversaw a rocky transition of the Newark airport's airspace to the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control (Tracon) last July.
And Duffy, who earlier this week unveiled a major plan to overhaul the nation's aging air traffic control system, claims the Biden administration is to blame for the recent problems, including air traffic control equipment outages.
""Maybe when you work from home, or maybe when you work from Michigan as a secretary, maybe you’re not focused on the real issues that are taking place throughout the airspace,"" Duffy said, as he took aim at Buttigieg, who lives in Michigan.
Buttigieg, responding, told reporters on Tuesday night that ""when you’re the secretary of transportation, you have a tough job and your responsibility is to fix tough problems. You don’t have time to indulge in trying to point fingers or blame other people.""
""What I can tell you is we inherited a shrinking air traffic control workforce. We turned it into a growing air traffic control workforce,"" he added. ""My successor is, of course, not asking for my advice, but my advice would be to making sure that it grows and actually delivering the technological change that’s needed.""

Buttigieg's Iowa trip also came on the same day that excerpts from a new book offered details on Biden's supposed mental and physical decline during his last two years in the White House.
Asked whether Biden experienced cognitive decline, Buttigieg would only say that ""every time I needed something from him from the West Wing, I got it.""
""The time I worked closest with him in his final year was around the Baltimore bridge collapse. And what I can tell you is that the same president the world saw addressing that was the president I was in the Oval with insisting that we do a good job, do right by Baltimore. And that characteristic of my experience with him,"" he added.

But he said ""maybe"" when asked whether the Democratic Party would have been better off if Biden had not run for re-election in 2024. ""Right now with the benefit of hindsight, I think most people would agree that that's the case.""
Biden dropped out of the race last July, one month after a disastrous debate performance with Trump sparked a chorus of calls from fellow Democrats for the then-81-year-old president to end his re-election bid. He was replaced at the top of the ticket by then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who ended up losing in November to Trump.

The Boeing 747 offered to the United States by Qatar will be given to the Department of Defense, President Donald Trump said Tuesday, responding to questions about the legality of accepting a gift from a foreign power.
Qatar's royal family offered to donate a $400 million jumbo jet that could serve as Air Force One.
The White House has pushed back against criticism of Trump, saying any gift from a foreign power is always accepted in full compliance with all laws.

""The Boeing 747 is being given to the United States Air Force/Department of Defense, NOT TO ME!"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform in the middle of his visit to Saudi Arabia. ""It is a gift from a Nation, Qatar, that we have successfully defended for many years. It will be used by our Government as a temporary Air Force One, until such time as our new Boeings, which are very late on delivery, arrive.""
Some Democrats have called for an ethics investigation over the gift.
On Sunday, Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., wrote to the Government Accountability Office, deriding the deal as a ""flying grift,"" arguing it violates the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which ""explicitly prohibits any person holding public office from accepting ‘any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.'""
HOUSE DEMOCRAT CALLS FOR 'IMMEDIATE' ETHICS PROBE OF QATARI PLANE GIFT TO TRUMP

""I am writing to express alarm over reports that President Donald Trump is poised to accept a luxury aircraft — a Boeing 747-8 — from the government of Qatar. The plane, so opulent it has been described as a ‘palace in the sky,’ is set to be made available to President Trump for official use as Air Force One and then for private use once he leaves office,"" Torres wrote.
Trump questioned why taxpayers should foot the bill for the aircraft when the U.S. can get one at no cost.
""This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" Trump wrote. ""Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""
Trump reportedly toured the plane in February when it was on the tarmac of the West Palm Beach Airport in Florida, ABC News reported over the weekend.

The gift has reportedly been tied up with legal reviews as the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice review the legality of the president accepting such a pricey gift from a foreign nation.
The current Air Force One fleet includes two planes, and Trump awarded Boeing a $3.9 billion contract in 2018, during his first term, to manufacture two new jets. The construction of the jets, however, is not expected to be completed until 2029.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmakers-target-online-pornography-propose-interstate-ban-obscene-content","GOP lawmakers target online pornography, propose interstate ban on obscene content","Texas high school student Elliston Berry joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to discuss the House’s passage of a new bill that criminalizes the sharing of non-consensual intimate images, including content created with artificial intelligence.
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced a bill aimed at criminalizing pornography and defining what is obscene and what is not.
Lee and Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., introduced the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA) for all states, which, if passed, would make it illegal to transmit obscene content across state lines while also making it easier to prosecute.
""Obscenity isn’t protected by the First Amendment, but hazy and unenforceable legal definitions have allowed extreme pornography to saturate American society and reach countless children,"" Lee said in a news release. ""Our bill updates the legal definition of obscenity for the internet age so this content can be taken down and its peddlers prosecuted.""
The IODA attempts to clarify the definition of obscenity in all states and gives updated descriptions that are suited to modern content.

Specifically, the new definition removes the current law’s dependence on ever-changing and elusive public opinion and replaces it with practical standards that make obscenity identifiable, according to Lee’s team.
Lee and Miller could not be reached by Fox News Digital for comment on their proposed bill.
The current legal definition of obscenity originated from a 1973 Supreme Court case, and the standards are subjective and vague, making it difficult to apply to any material.

Because the pre-internet standards are so vague, they often present challenges in court when it comes to defining what is obscene and ultimately allow ""criminals to evade prosecution,"" the press release said.
Lee’s IODA defines ""obscenity"" within the Communications Act of 1934 and ""appeals to the prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion.""

The bill also ""depicts, describes or represents actual or simulated sex acts"" intended to ""arouse, titillate or gratify"" a person’s sexual desires. Adding to that, the bill identifies obscene material as that which ""lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.""
The IODA also removes the ""intent"" requirement, which only prohibits the transmission of obscene material for the purpose of abusing, threatening or harassing an individual.

""The Interstate Obscenity Definition Act equips law enforcement with the tools they need to target and remove obscene material from the internet, which is alarmingly destructive and far outside the bounds of protected free speech under the Constitution,"" Miller said.
""I’m proud to lead this effort in the House with Sen. Lee to safeguard American families and ensure this dangerous material is kept out of our homes and off our screens.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-republican-announces-campaign-governor-vows-fix-what-tim-walz-broke","Minnesota Republican announces campaign for governor, vows to ‘fix’ what Tim Walz ‘broke’","The Republican, businessman and U.S. Army veteran spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital ahead of his campaign launch on Tuesday.
FIRST ON FOX: Army veteran and business executive Kendall Qualls has officially launched his campaign to challenge former Democrat vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz to be the next governor of Minnesota.
While Walz has not yet formally announced a third consecutive gubernatorial bid, Qualls, who also ran for governor in 2022, framed the race for Minnesota's highest office as an opportunity to fix the problems Walz created.
""I'm running because, after a 16-year reign of failed leadership, the citizens of Minnesota are looking for a different direction. They're looking for new leadership, and I'm here to make sure they get it,"" Qualls told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview ahead of his campaign launch on Tuesday night.
In a statement shared first with Fox News Digital, Qualls said he is the only candidate who can help Minnesota reach its potential.

""I don’t need to tell you that Minnesota is at a crossroads,"" Qualls said in a statement. ""Tim Walz took us further down the road of lost jobs, fleeing companies, rising crime and cratering education. Now, he’s spending more time outside the state on a vanity tour than he is trying to move Minnesota forward. That’s not leadership.""
WHITE HOUSE TORCHES TIM WALZ'S SPEECH ABOUT TRUMP'S 'GULAGS,' 'CHAOS': 'HIS LARGEST CITY BURNED TO THE GROUND'
Qualls explained that Minnesotans want to build the economy, feel safe in their communities and improve education, but ""we're not going to get any of those changes from Tim Walz.""
""I’m the only candidate who can help Minnesota live up to its potential. If we are going to fix the budget Tim Walz broke, we need a proven leader with real-world business experience. If we are going to take back our streets and our classrooms, we need a candidate with a conservative backbone and law and order credentials,"" Qualls said.
Qualls said the only way to create the change that Minnesotans are asking for is to bring in a political outsider like himself.

""Much like President Trump with his experience in business and leadership, my background has been in business. And before that, I was an officer in the United States Army. And even before that, I grew up in dire poverty. I know that there's a formula for success in this country, even if we don't come from a background of privilege,"" Qualls said.
The gubernatorial candidate said he wants Americans to know there is a pathway forward in the United States for anyone to succeed, regardless of their background or where they went to school. But Qualls said the government has a responsibility to get out of the way of those pathways to success.
""There are pathways out. And unfortunately, what I'm finding with the Democrats is that they have been closing those doors of prosperity. When I turned 18 years old, I registered as a Republican, and I never looked back. I didn't know any Republicans. I didn't have a country club membership, but what I did know was what the Democrats were doing in the Black community was something I didn't want to be a part of. They weren't helping. They were making things worse,"" Qualls said, who grew up in poverty in Harlem in New York and in a trailer park in Oklahoma.

While Qualls is presenting his campaign as the only alternative to what he describes as the destruction of Minnesota's current Democrat rule, it's not his first time running for the state's highest office.
""In this last election, I finished number two out of seven candidates in the Republican endorsement process. I agreed to abide by the endorsement. I actually endorsed. The candidate that won. But unfortunately, in that election in 2022, we lost everything, the governorship, Senate, House, attorney general, everything. And a lot of people felt that maybe we had the wrong candidate at the top of the ticket,"" Qualls said.
But Qualls said this time is different.

""I worked around the state for four years helping candidates raise money, just rallying the troops,"" Qualls said. ""There's a sense of true leadership that people haven't seen before.""
Leaning on his increased name recognition this time around, Qualls said he is focused on building a grassroots coalition of Minnesota Republicans who are ready for change.
Walz did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-debate-trump-restrictions-birthright-citizenship-enforcement-nationwide-injunctions","Supreme Court to debate Trump restrictions on birthright citizenship and enforcement of nationwide injunctions","Former federal prosecutor Andrea Lewis discusses the Supreme Court's effect on the Trump administration's immigration agenda, a Columbia student being released from ICE and how the highest court could redefine the First Amendment.
The case on the Supreme Court's docket this week ostensibly deals with a challenge to the Trump administration's efforts to narrow the definition of birthright citizenship.
But overriding that important constitutional debate is a more immediate and potentially far-reaching test of judicial power: the ability of individual federal judges to issue universal or nationwide injunctions, preventing temporary enforcement of President Donald Trump's sweeping executive actions.
That will be the focus when the nine justices hear oral arguments Thursday morning about how President Trump's restrictions on who can be called an American citizen can proceed in the lower federal courts.
Trump signed the executive order on his first day back in office that would end automatic citizenship for children of people in the U.S. illegally.
SUPREME COURT POISED TO MAKE MAJOR DECISION THAT COULD SET LIMITS ON THE POWER OF DISTRICT JUDGES
In addressing the Trump administration's birthright citizenship case, the Supreme Court will also be posed a much broader question concerning the injunction power of federal judges. (Getty Images)
Separate coalitions of about two dozen states, along with immigrant rights groups, and private individuals — including several pregnant women in Maryland — have sued.
Three separate federal judges subsequently issued orders temporarily blocking enforcement across the country while the issues are fully litigated in court. Appeals courts have declined to disturb those rulings.
Now the three consolidated cases come to the high court in an unusual scenario, a rare May oral argument that has been fast-tracked for an expected ruling in coming days or weeks.
The executive order remains on hold nationwide until the justices decide.
But the cases will likely not be decided on the merits at this stage, only on whether to narrow the scope of those injunctions. That would allow the policy to take effect in limited parts of the country or only to those plaintiffs actually suing over the president's authority.
SUPREME COURT TO HEAR ORAL ARGUMENTS IN BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP CASE
A high court decision could be sweeping, setting a precedent that would affect the more than 310 — and counting — federal lawsuits against White House actions filed since Jan. 20, according to a Fox News data analysis.
Of those, more than 200 judicial orders have halted large parts of the president's agenda from being enacted, almost 40 of them nationwide injunctions. Dozens of other cases have seen no legal action so far on gateway issues like temporary enforcement.
While the Supreme Court has never ruled directly on the use of universal injunctions, several conservative justices have expressed concerns over  power.
Justice Clarence Thomas in 2018 labeled them ""legally and historically dubious,"" adding, ""These injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the federal court system – preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch.""

And it comes to the Supreme Court as part of the so-called emergency or ""shadow"" docket, time-sensitive appeals known officially as ""applications"" that usually arrive in the early stages.
They seek to temporarily block or delay a lower court or government action that, despite its procedurally narrow posture, can have immediate and far-reaching implications.
Things like requests for stays of execution, voting restrictions, COVID vaccine mandates or access to a federally approved abortion medication and, since January, Trump's sweeping executive reform plans.
Some members of the court have expressed concern that these kinds of appeals are arriving with greater frequency in recent years, high-profile issues leading to rushed decisions without the benefit of full briefing or deliberation.
'ACTIVIST' JUDGES KEEP TRYING TO CURB TRUMP’S AGENDA – HERE’S HOW HE COULD PUSH BACK
Justice Elena Kagan last year said the shadow docket's caseload has been ""relentless,"" adding, ""We’ve gotten into a pattern where we're doing too many of them.""
The pace this term has only increased with the new administration frustrated at dozens of lower court setbacks.
""We've seen a lot of justices critical of the fact that the court is taking an increasing number of cases and deciding them using the shadow docket,"" said Thomas Dupree, a former top Justice Department lawyer and a top appellate advocate.
""These justices say, 'Look, we don't have to decide this on an emergency basis. We can wait.'""
The Supreme Court's ""shadow"" docket caseload is ""relentless,"" according to Justice Elena Kagan. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
Many progressive lawyers complain the Trump administration has been too eager to bypass the normal district and intermediate appellate court process, seeking quick, end-around Supreme Court review on consequential questions of law only when it loses.
The debate over birthright citizenship and injunctions is expected to expose further ideological divides on the court's 6-3 conservative majority.
That is especially true when it comes to the 13 challenges over Trump policies that have reached the justices so far, with six of them awaiting a ruling.
The court's three more liberal justices have pushed back at several preliminary victories for the administration, including its ban on transgender individuals serving in the military and the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport scores of illegal immigrants suspected of criminal gang activity in the U.S.
TRUMP'S REMARKS COULD COME BACK TO BITE HIM IN ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION BATTLE
Dissenting in one such emergency appeal over the deportations to El Salvador, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, ""The Government’s conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law.""
""Our job is to stand up for people who can't do it themselves. And our job is to be the champion of lost causes,"" Sotomayor separately told an American Bar Association audience last week. ""But, right now, we can't lose the battles we are facing. And we need trained and passionate and committed lawyers to fight this fight.""

Trump has made no secret of his disdain for judges who have ruled against his policies or at least blocked them from being immediately implemented.
He called for the formal removal of one federal judge after an adverse decision over deporting illegal immigrants. That prompted Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare public statement, saying, ""Impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.""
And in separate remarks last week, the chief justice underscored the judiciary's duty to ""check the excesses of Congress or the executive.""
The first section of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""
Trump said last month he was ""so happy"" the Supreme Court will hear arguments, adding, ""I think the case has been so misunderstood.""
The president said the 14th Amendment, granting automatic citizenship to people born in the U.S., was ratified right after the Civil War, which he interpreted as ""all about slavery.""
""If you look at it that way, we would win that case,"" the president said in Oval Office remarks.

Executive Order 14160, ""Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,"" would deny it to those born after Feb. 19 whose parents are illegal immigrants. And it bans federal agencies from issuing or accepting documents recognizing citizenship for those children.
An estimated 4.4 million American-born children under 18 are living with an unauthorized immigrant parent, according to the Pew Research Center. There are approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country, 3.3% of the population. Although some census experts suggest those numbers may be higher.
But in its legal brief filed with the high court, the Justice Department argues the issue now is really about judges blocking enforcement of the president's policies while the cases weave their way through the courts, a process that could last months or even years. The government initially framed its high court appeal as a ""modest request.""
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS ADDRESSES DIVISIONS BETWEEN JUSTICES AFTER SEVERAL RECENT SCOTUS SKIRMISHES
""These injunctions exceed the district courts’ authority under Article III [of the Constitution] and gravely encroach on the President’s executive power under Article II,"" said Solicitor General John Sauer, who will argue the administration's case Thursday. ""Until this Court decides whether nationwide injunctions are permissible, a carefully selected subset of district courts will persist in granting them as a matter of course, relying on malleable eye-of-the-beholder criteria.""
The plaintiffs counter the government is misguided in what it calls ""citizenship stripping"" and the use of nationwide injunctions.

""Being directed to follow the law as it has been universally understood for over 125 years is not an emergency warranting the extraordinary remedy of a stay,"" said Nicholas Brown, the attorney general of Washington state. ""If this Court steps in when the applicant [government] is so plainly wrong on the law, there will be no end to stay applications and claims of emergency, undermining the proper role and stature of this Court. This Court should deny the applications.""
The consolidated cases are Trump v. CASA (24a884); Trump v. State of Washington (24a885); Trump v. New Jersey (24a886).

(@DHSgov via X)
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Tuesday fired back at Democrat Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell's public accusation that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents ""do not share [the state's] values of safety"" after a Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) operation in coordination with ICE resulted in nearly 200 illegal immigrant arrests.
ICE and THP announced 196 arrests of illegal immigrants during the Nashville effort, 95 of whom had prior criminal convictions and pending criminal charges.
More than 30 were previously removed individuals who reentered the U.S. illegally, a felony offense under federal law.

ICE TOUTS RECORD-BREAKING IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT DURING TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS
Despite the operation's success in protecting Americans from illegal immigrants, DHS officials wrote in a news release that O’Connell ""stands by pro-illegal policies, claiming that these operations were done by ‘people who do not share our values of safety.’""
DHS noted ""attacks and demonization of ICE"" have resulted in officers facing a 413% increase in assaults.
""You would think all public officials would unite around DHS bringing violent criminal illegal aliens to justice and removing them from American communities,"" DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a news release. ""However, pro-open borders politicians – like Mayor O’Connell – would rather protect illegal aliens than American citizens.""

""This operation resulted in getting gang members, sex offenders, and other violent criminals off Nashville’s streets,"" McLaughlin added. ""President [Donald] Trump and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem will continue to stand with victims and the brave ICE agents who are on the front lines, making America safe again.""
Though O’Connell launched the ""Belonging Fund"" to provide taxpayer dollars for illegal immigrants in Nashville, DHS officials stood firm, saying, ""BOTTOM LINE: DHS is [a] law enforcement agency, and it will continue to enforce the law and work with all state and local partners so that Americans do not continue to be victimized by criminal aliens.""
Below are detainees who ICE officials said were nabbed during the Nashville operation.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-upholds-trumps-authority-deport-criminal-migrants-alien-enemies-act","Judge upholds Trump's authority to deport criminal migrants under Alien Enemies Act","Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to react to the Supreme Court’s decision upholding the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to carry out mass deportation flights.
A federal judge on Tuesday said the Trump administration can invoke the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport criminal illegal immigrant members of the Venezuelan Tren De Aragua gang, but that it has not given adequate prior notice to those subject to removal, before those deportations can take place, which would allow possible due process and habeas legal challenges.
The 43-page ruling by U.S. District Judge Stephanie Haines, a Trump appointee, conflicts with other rulings challenging the administration's deportation efforts.
TRUMP ADMIN REVOKES 4K FOREIGN STUDENTS' VISAS IN FIRST 100 DAYS, NEARLY ALL WITH SERIOUS CRIMINAL RECORDS

""Having done its job, the Court now leaves it to the Political Branches of the government, and ultimately to the people who elect those individuals, to decide whether the laws and those executing them continue to reflect their will,"" Haines wrote.
Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House.
Trump issued an executive order on March 14, ""Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua.""
Tuesday's ruling was confined to Venezuelan aliens who are not naturalized or lawful permanent residents, 14 years or older, and have been specifically designated as part of a Foreign Terrorist Organization, specifically Tren de Aragua.

More than 250 suspected gang members arrive in El Salvador by plane, including 238 members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang and 23 members of the MS-13 gang, who were deported to El Salvador by the US in San Salvador, El Salvador on Mar.16, 2025. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele confirmed they will be sent to the country's infamous mega-prison at CECOP facility prison.

Earlier this month, another judge stated that he would not prevent the administration from deporting individuals in the U.S. illegally but that the Alien Enemies Act could not be used as a basis to expel alleged gang members from the country.
""The question that this lawsuit presents is whether the President can utilize a specific statute, the AEA, to detain and remove Venezuelan aliens who are members of [Tren de Aragua]"" U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., another Trump appointee, wrote in his order.

""As to that question, the historical record renders clear that the president’s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute’s terms,"" the order states.

Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Baraka compared his arrest at a federal immigration center last week to the Bible's accounts of King David, telling a crowd at a political rally in his city Tuesday afternoon that it was ""our David moment.""
Baraka has repeatedly insisted he did nothing wrong, calling his tactics ""absolutely effective"" during a Democrat primary debate for the race for governor in New Jersey that took place Monday evening. He followed up the defense of his tactics Tuesday by comparing his arrest to the story of King David in the Bible.
""This is our David moment,"" Baraka told a crowd of several dozen supporters at a rally in his hometown on Tuesday. ""Many of us miss our David moment because we [are] trying to run away from confrontation and controversy. But your crowd lives in the middle of controversy. The thing that has been promised to you is surrounded by high walls, and the gates are guarded by giants. If you're running from conflict and controversy, then you'll never get what's promised of you. This is our David moment.""
FAR-LEFT MAYOR ARRESTED AT ICE FACILITY DENIES IMPEDING LAW ENFORCEMENT, SAYS PROTEST 'ABSOLUTELY' EFFECTIVE
Newark, New Jersey Mayor Ras Baraka, who is in the running to be the state's next governor, compared his arrest while protesting a federal immigration detention facility to the biblical story of King David while speaking at a political rally Tuesday afternoon. (FOX NEWS: Stephanie Keith)
Baraka told supporters that he physically could not have done anything to prevent his arrest at the immigration detention center on Friday, telling them his body ""froze"" involuntarily after being told he was going to be arrested for trespassing at the facility.
""When the congressman came to the gate and was like, 'Mayor, they said they're going to arrest you.' That was a David moment,"" Baraka said Tuesday. ""I could have gotten in the car and ran. I could have said, 'I’m getting out of here, maybe they'll arrest me at work or at home or whatever.' But I froze. I froze – not even actively or deliberately – my body froze. My body – my body froze, like, 'This is it, you’re supposed to be here. Whatever they going to do, they going to do it.'""
Baraka's arrest occurred during a protest at Delaney Hall attended by three members of Congress, who said they were in attendance to perform their congressionally mandated oversight duties related to federal detention facilities.
WHO IS THE DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING AT AN ICE DETENTION CENTER?
The three congressional lawmakers and Baraka were outside the facility with a group of protesters when the gates opened to allow an ICE bus in. All four officials then allegedly rushed through the gates and past security, according to officials from the Department of Homeland Security.
The arrest came as activists had been calling for access to the facility for days, which is a privately run facility that was revamped as an immigration detention facility this year.
In addition to comparing his debacle with federal authorities to King David, Baraka also made light of his arrest Tuesday, quipping that he was speaking to attendees at the rally Tuesday ""as a returning citizen.""
""Pardon me, ‘formerly incarcerated,’"" Baraka said, garnering laughter from the crowd.

""They told me I got to check in, and they ain't talking about the hood either,"" Baraka added. ""I got to check in, I have to give them all my information, all this stuff, all my family's information. I mean, I'm making light of it, but it's real. I got to go to court Thursday. Are these people … serious? They're really trying to go forward with this and leverage it to make me be quiet.""
Baraka confirmed to Fox News Digital on Tuesday that he was back at the detention facility Tuesday morning. The Newark mayor also confirmed that he participated in a pretrial intervention phone call ahead of a Thursday court hearing over the matter. Media reports have indicated that Baraka plans to plead not guilty.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/capitol-police-arrest-protesters-disrupting-budget-markup-cory-booker-thanks-them-defending-medicaid","Capitol Police arrest protesters disrupting budget markup as Cory Booker thanks them for defending Medicaid","Fox News Digital captured video of Capitol Police arresting protesters who disrupted the budget markup on Tuesday as Democrats continue to warn of Medicaid cuts. At one point, Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ, appears to cheer them on.
More than two dozen protesters were arrested for disrupting the House Energy and Commerce's budget reconciliation markup on Tuesday, as Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., thanked those holding court in the hallway.
""Around 2 p.m., 26 people were arrested for illegally demonstrating in the Rayburn House Office Building. They were arrested for 22-1307 Crowding, Obstructing, and Incommoding. It is against the law to protest inside the Congressional Buildings,"" the U.S. Capitol Police Department told Fox News Digital.
Dozens of protesters, many in wheelchairs, filled the halls outside the John D. Dingell Room in the Rayburn House Office Building on Tuesday afternoon, chanting, ""No cuts to Medicaid!"" Several protesters, who were blocking the entrance to the committee room, were wheeled away and arrested by Capitol police after multiple warnings.
A defiant Booker walked by the budget markup during its first hour and was greeted by the cheers and whistles of those protesting Medicaid cuts. Booker, who spent more than 12 hours protesting President Donald Trump's agenda on the steps of the U.S. Capitol just two weeks ago, thanked the protesters for showing up to protect Medicaid.

A Capitol police officer confirmed to Fox News Digital that disruptors were arrested for protesting and would be processed and released immediately. Many protesters remained in the hallway during the first few hours of the markup as others were removed for shouting during the representative's testimonies and subsequently arrested.
ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION
""The audience is supportive that you're all here and participating. We want you here. You're part of the process. We want you to be here, but we have to proceed. And the rules of the House, and the law is that – if you're disruptive, you'll be removed, and you're subject to arrest. I don't make that decision, the Capitol Police does,"" Kentucky Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said following one of several disruptions by protesters.
Inside the budget markup, Democrats and Republicans sparred over rhetoric about Medicaid cuts. Democrats claimed the Republican budget bill would cut vital access to Medicaid, with many representatives sharing stories of their constituents who have benefited from its services. Meanwhile, Republicans accused Democrats of lying to the American people about Medicaid cuts – a word Guthrie deterred his colleagues from using.
""I want to send one very clear message: you're being lied to. The other side is telling you a lot of things about this legislation. I'm not sure they have read this legislation,"" Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., who chairs the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, said.
Republicans mostly avoided the deep cuts to Medicaid pushed by fiscal conservatives in the House Republican Conference, which could serve to benefit moderate Republicans who have fielded relentless attacks from Democrats over potential Medicaid cuts. House Republicans, however, have vowed to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program.

The committee's budget markup includes increased regulations and program cuts to Medicaid, including tightened address verification requirements, ensuring deceased individuals are not enrolled, more provider screening requirements, removing excess Medicaid payments, revising home equity limits for determining eligibility, prohibiting illegal immigrants from obtaining Medicaid services, ensuring accurate payments, prohibiting funding for gender transition procedures for minors and requirements for states to establish Medicaid community engagement programs.
""This budget does not cut Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security benefits for the Americans who truly need them. We are strengthening and protecting Medicaid for pregnant women, children, individuals with disabilities, low-income seniors and vulnerable families. These Americans will continue to have access to the care they need and deserve. What we are doing is eliminating waste, fraud and abuse,"" Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Indiana, told the committee.
But despite Republicans' assurances that the proposed budget does not cut Medicaid, Democrats testified, one after the other, about the threats program cuts pose to Americans.

""They are cutting this Medicaid care and these Medicaid dollars to pay for tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires, so this money isn't even going towards funding better care for people who are eligible… We are cutting money and health care from people and families who are suffering, to pay for tax cuts for the rich. It is a crime happening in front of the American public right now,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said.
The proposed legislation would put a new 80-hour-per-month work requirement on certain able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid, aged 19 through 64.
It would also put guardrails on states spending funds on their expanded Medicaid populations. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to adults who make up to 138% of the poverty level.

More specifically, states that provide Medicaid coverage to illegal immigrants could see their federal Medicaid reimbursement dollars diminished, putting more of that cost on the state itself.
The bill would also require states with expanded Medicaid populations to perform eligibility checks every six months to ensure the system is not being abused.

The Energy & Commerce Committee, which has broad jurisdiction, including over federal health programs, telecommunications and energy, was tasked with finding at least $880 billion in spending cuts to pay for other priorities in Trump's ""big, beautiful bill.""
Guthrie told House Republicans on a lawmaker-only call on Sunday night that the panel had found ""north of $900 billion"" in savings.

The U.S. State Department has determined and certified Cuba as a ""not fully cooperating country"" (NFCC) for not helping with counterterrorism efforts after the island nation failed to turn over at least 11 fugitives in 2024 to U.S. custody.
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce made the announcement on Tuesday that the certification, which falls under Section 40A of the Arms Export Control Act, will result in the prohibition on the sale or license for export of defense services to Cuba.
""In 2024, the Cuban regime did not fully cooperate with the United States on counterterrorism,"" Bruce said in a statement. ""There were at least 11 U.S. fugitives from justice in Cuba, including several facing terrorism-related charges, and the Cuban regime made clear it was not willing to discuss their return to face justice in our nation.""
""The Cuban regime’s refusal to engage on this important issue, as well as other recent circumstances of non-cooperation on terrorism-related law enforcement matters, made efforts to cooperate on counterterrorism issues futile in 2024,"" she continued.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio not only certified Cuba as an NFCC, he also re-certified Iran, Syria, Venezuela and North Korea as NFCCs.
In January, the Biden administration lifted Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, reversing a move made by the Trump administration in 2021.
Former President Joe Biden said at the time that the Cuban government ""has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding six-month period"" as well as ""provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future.""

Cuba was given the designation in January 2021, shortly before Biden took office. At the time, the U.S. Embassy in Cuba accused the country of ""repeatedly providing support for acts of international terrorism in granting safe harbor to terrorists.""
The designation returned the Caribbean nation to a list that it was on from the Reagan administration to that of former President Barack Obama. In 2016, Obama became the first U.S. president to visit Cuba since 1928.

The Obama administration attempted to normalize relations in 2015 but encountered resistance from President Donald Trump, whose administration recently argued that Cuba has failed to cooperate on counterterrorism.
State Department officials said Cuba refused to extradite 10 suspects wanted in Colombia for a police academy bombing that killed 22 people and injured dozens more.

Authorities also accused Cuba of harboring multiple American fugitives, including Joanne Chesimard, also known as Assata Shakur. She was convicted of killing New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1973.
In the summer of 2017, Trump imposed travel and financial restrictions on Cuba while blasting as ""one-sided"" Obama's 2016 deal with the regime.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced Tuesday it is taking a step toward ""ending outdated practices"" related to children's health and will begin removing ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for kids from the market.
Health and Human Services and the FDA are ""taking bold action to protect America’s children by initiating the removal of unapproved, ingestible fluoride prescription drug products from the market,"" Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon told Fox News Digital Tuesday. ""These fluoride prescription drug products, given to infants and toddlers, have never been approved by the FDA and pose real risks to developing children — including harm to the gut microbiome, potential thyroid dysfunction, weight gain, and even reduced IQ. This is not just a public health issue — it’s a moral issue.""
""This marks another step toward delivering on our Make America Healthy Again promise — by ending outdated practices and putting Gold Standard Science at the center of children’s health,"" he added.
The FDA announced earlier Tuesday it had begun the initial steps of removing ""concentrated ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for children from the market.""
Fluoride is frequently used to protect teeth from decay and cavities.
DESANTIS SIGNS BILL BANNING FLUORIDE ADDITIVES IN FLORIDA PUBLIC WATER: 'HYDRATE, NOT MEDICATE'
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., pictured here with Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary, said that ""ending the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue."" (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)
Ingestible fluoride, such as tablets prescribed to kids at high-risk for cavities, was never approved by the FDA, according to its chief, Marty Makary, and have been ""shown to alter the gut microbiome,"" as well as possible association ""between fluoride and thyroid disorders, weight gain and possibly decreased IQ.""
Ingestible fluoride is swallowed, and differs from other fluoride products, such as toothpaste bolstered with fluoride.
UTAH BANS FLUORIDE FROM PUBLIC DRINKING WATER, ALIGNING WITH MAHA MOVEMENT
Makary said in a Tuesday press release that children can avoid heavy sugar intake to dodge cavities instead of ""altering a child’s microbiome."" The gut microbiome is the ecosystem of microorganisms that live in a person's intestines.

""The best way to prevent cavities in children is by avoiding excessive sugar intake and good dental hygiene, not by altering a child’s microbiome,"" Makary said in the press release. ""For the same reason that fluoride may kill bacteria on teeth, it may also kill intestinal bacteria important for a child’s health.""
""I am instructing our Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to evaluate the evidence regarding the risks of systemic fluoride exposure from FDA-regulated pediatric ingestible fluoride prescription drug products to better inform parents and the medical community on this emerging area. When it comes to children, we should err on the side of safety.""
FLUORIDE EXPOSURE LINKED TO ‘DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS’ ON HEALTH OF PREGNANT WOMEN, INFANTS
Nixon told Fox News Digital that HHS and the FDA will launch a full safety review, including with public input, as health leaders work to finalize details of the plan by Oct. 31.
Dr. Marty Makary said the best way to ""prevent cavities in children is by avoiding excessive sugar intake and good dental hygiene, not by altering a child’s microbiome.""  (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images )
""The American people deserve transparency and accountability,"" Nixon said. ""The Department will issue new guidelines promoting safe, effective dental hygiene without compromising gut health.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/rubio-doubts-anything-productive-happen-ukraine-peace-talks-without-trump-putin","Rubio doubts 'anything productive' will happen in Ukraine peace talks without Trump, Putin","Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to reporters in Antalya, Turkey and said he would travel to Istanbul for meetings on Friday. (Video: Reuters.)
Secretary of State Macro Rubio cast a pessimistic tone ahead of talks in Turkey now set for Friday after both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump said they would not be in attendance.
The peace talks, which were supposed to happen on Thursday, got thrown into disarray after both Russian and Ukrainian delegations, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, landed in various cities in Turkey as confirmation arrived that not only would Putin not be engaging in the discussions, but neither would senior members from the Kremlin.
According to reports, frustration grew as the delegations and mediators spent much of the day questioning when, and even whether, they would meet on Thursday before the meeting was ultimately pushed to Friday.

TRUMP TO SKIP RUSSIA-UKRAINE PEACE TALKS, CALLS ZELENSKYY THE ‘GREATEST SALESMAN, MAYBE IN HISTORY’
""Frankly, at this point, I think it's abundantly clear that the only way we're going to have a breakthrough here is between President Trump and President Putin,"" Rubio told reporters. ""It's going to require that level of engagement to have a breakthrough in this matter.
""I don't think anything productive is actually going to happen from this point forward… until they engage in a very frank and direct conversation, which I know President Trump is willing to do,"" he added.
The peace talks first came about after Putin suggested last week that Ukraine and Russia should engage in direct talks. Zelenskyy agreed and said those talks should be held by the leaders of the warring nations.
Trump sparked surprise earlier this week when he suggested he might travel to Turkey from the UAE if progress was made in the talks on Thursday, but it was never previously suggested that the U.S. president, who was set to be wrapping up a Middle East tour, would be present for the negotiations.

PUTIN PROPOSES DIRECT PEACE TALKS WITH UKRAINE TO END WAR
The Kremlin on Thursday confirmed Putin was not going to participate in the peace talks.
Aboard Air Force One on Thursday, Trump suggested Putin did not attend because of a scheduling miscommunication and told reporters that there was no hope on any real progress in negotiations until he and Putin speak.
""Look, nothing's going to happen until Putin and I get together. OK?"" Trump said. ""He was going to go, but he thought I was going to go. He wasn't going if I wasn't there.
""I don't believe anything's going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,"" he added.
Any future plans for Trump and Putin to talk remain unknown.
""What I can say with certainty is that the president's… willing to stick with [this] as long as it takes to achieve peace,"" Rubio said. ""What we cannot do, however, is continue to fly all over the world and engage in meetings that are not going to be productive.

""The only way we're going to have a breakthrough here is with President Trump sitting face to face with President Putin and determining once and for all whether there's a path to peace,"" he added.
Zelenskyy did not hold back in expressing his frustration over what he said is proof that Putin’s ""attitude is unserious.""
""No time of the meeting, no agenda, no high-level of delegation – this is personal disrespect to Erdoğan, to Trump,"" Zelenskyy reportedly said at a Thursday news conference after meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-makes-historic-uae-visit-first-us-president-nearly-30-years","Trump makes historic UAE visit as first US president in nearly 20 years","Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlison reports on President Donald Trump’s Middle East visit. The ‘Outnumbered’ panelists discuss the president's high-stakes meeting with Syria’s president and what it signals for U.S. foreign policy.
President Donald Trump on Thursday arrived in the United Arab Emirates for his final stop in the Middle East this week in a visit that marked the first time a U.S. president has traveled to the nation in nearly 20 years, following President George W. Bush's trip in 2008.
Trump, who has secured major business deals first in Saudi Arabia and then Qatar, is expected to announce more agreements with what has long been one of the U.S.’ chief trading partners in the region — though given recently announced trillion-dollar deals, it is unclear what more the Emiratis will agree to.
In March, the UAE pledged a $1.4 trillion investment in the U.S. economy over the next decade through AI infrastructure, semiconductor, energy and American manufacturing initiatives, including a plan to nearly double U.S. aluminum production by investing in a new smelter for the first time in 35 years.

TRUMP SIGNS AGREEMENTS WITH QATAR ON DEFENSE AND BOEING PURCHASES
On the eve of the president’s visit to the Middle Eastern nation, the State Department also announced a $1.4 billion sale of CH-47 F Chinook helicopters and F-16 fighter jet parts to Abu Dhabi.
However, lawmakers on Wednesday suggested they may block this sale amid concerns over direct personal business ties, as Trump’s crypto venture has also received a $2 billion investment by a UAE-backed investment firm.
""If I was a betting person, I’d bet that the Emiratis almost certainly kept some things in reserve for President Trump’s actual visit that can be announced when he’s on the ground in Abu Dhabi,"" John Hannah, former national security advisor to Dick Cheney and current Randi & Charles Wax senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), told Fox News Digital. ""I wouldn’t be at all surprised if we see some new items unveiled or some additional details put out on some of the earlier announcements.""
""The UAE has clearly staked its future on being the Middle East leader in a wide range of 21st-century technologies, from AI to chips to space,"" he added. ""And of course, the shopping list for high-end weapons is almost limitless and always a possible deliverable for a trip like this.""
Increased scrutiny arose around Trump’s Middle East tour as engagement with all three nations holds personal value to him, given the Trump Organization’s luxury resorts, hotels, golf courses, real estate projects and crypto investment schemes in the region.

TRUMP CONTINUES TO DEFEND QATAR GIFTING US $400M JET: 'WE SHOULD HAVE THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PLANE'
But all three nations also hold significant value to Washington, as they have become key players in some of the toughest geopolitical issues facing the U.S. and its allies.
Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been integral in facilitating U.S. negotiations when it comes to ending Russia’s war in Ukraine and hostage negotiations in the Gaza Strip.
While neither of these issues appeared to be top points of discussion in Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia or Qatar, he may hit on geopolitical ties more heavily when it comes to the UAE, particularly given that Abu Dhabi is one of the few Middle Eastern nations that holds normalized diplomatic ties with Israel.
The UAE has ardently opposed Israel’s military operations in the Gaza Strip, has called for a two-state solution, and has rejected Trump’s ""riviera plans,"" instead favoring an Egypt-reconstruction alternative.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)
But Abu Dhabi has also maintained relations with the U.S.’ biggest adversaries, including China, Russia and Iran, which could be a topic of conversation during Trump’s one-day visit.
""As everywhere on this trip, the headlines will likely be dominated by the dollar signs and deal-making,"" Hannah said. ""But I’m personally most interested in the geopolitical angle of trying to reset the U.S.-Emirati strategic partnership, especially in the context of America’s great power competition with China and to a lesser extent Russia, and regionally with Iran.""

Hannah explained that Trump's visit to the UAE exemplifies a recommitment by the U.S. economically and militarily to support Abu Dhabi’s ""stability, security, and success in a dangerous neighborhood"" and could ""pay real dividends going forward.""
""The UAE’s top leadership has come to believe that putting most of its eggs into the American basket was an increasingly risky bet as one president after another decided that the Middle East was a lost cause — nothing but ‘blood and sand’ as President Trump famously said in his first term — and the country needed to pivot its focus toward Asia,"" he continued. ""With a country as influential and resource-rich as the UAE, correcting that unhelpful perception and putting the strategic relationship back on a much more positive dynamic is an important goal.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/hidden-devices-found-chinese-solar-power-inverters-spark-national-security-alarm","Hidden communications devices found in Chinese solar power inverters spark security alarm","President Trump discusses lowering prescription drug prices, relations with China and his trip to Saudi Arabia on 'Hannity.'
U.S. energy officials are reassessing the risk posed by Chinese-made devices that play a critical role in renewable energy infrastructure after unexplained communication equipment was found inside some of them, two people familiar with the matter said.
Power inverters, which are predominantly produced in China, are used throughout the world to connect solar panels and wind turbines to electricity grids. They are also found in batteries, heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers.
While inverters are built to allow remote access for updates and maintenance, the utility companies that use them typically install firewalls to prevent direct communication back to China.
CHINESE OFFICIALS CLAIMED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS PRC PLAYED ROLE IN US CYBERATTACKS: REPORT
However, rogue communication devices not listed in product documents have been found in some Chinese solar power inverters by U.S. experts who strip down equipment hooked up to grids to check for security issues, the two people said.
Over the past nine months, undocumented communication devices, including cellular radios, have also been found in some batteries from multiple Chinese suppliers, one of them said.
Reuters was unable to determine how many solar power inverters and batteries they have looked at.

The rogue components provide additional, undocumented communication channels that could allow firewalls to be circumvented remotely, with potentially catastrophic consequences, the two people said.
Both declined to be named because they did not have permission to speak to the media.
""We know that China believes there is value in placing at least some elements of our core infrastructure at risk of destruction or disruption,"" said Mike Rogers, a former director of the U.S. National Security Agency. ""I think that the Chinese are, in part, hoping that the widespread use of inverters limits the options that the West has to deal with the security issue.""
A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said: ""We oppose the generalization of the concept of national security, distorting and smearing China's infrastructure achievements.""
Using the rogue communication devices to skirt firewalls and switch off inverters remotely, or change their settings, could destabilize power grids, damage energy infrastructure, and trigger widespread blackouts, experts said.
""That effectively means there is a built-in way to physically destroy the grid,"" one of the people said,
The two people declined to name the Chinese manufacturers of the inverters and batteries with extra communication devices, nor say how many they had found in total.
The existence of the rogue devices has not previously been reported. The U.S. government has not publicly acknowledged the discoveries.
Asked for comment, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) said it continually assesses risk associated with emerging technologies and that there were significant challenges with manufacturers disclosing and documenting functionalities.
""While this functionality may not have malicious intent, it is critical for those procuring to have a full understanding of the capabilities of the products received,"" a spokesperson said.
Work is ongoing to address any gaps in disclosures through ""Software Bill of Materials"" - or inventories of all the components that make up a software application - and other contractual requirements, the spokesperson said.
As U.S.-China tensions escalate, the U.S. and others are reassessing China's role in strategic infrastructure because of concerns about potential security vulnerabilities, two former government officials said.
""The threat we face from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is real and growing. Whether it's telecom hacks or remotely accessing solar and battery inverters, the CCP stops at nothing to target our sensitive infrastructure and components,"" said U.S. Representative August Pfluger, a Republican member of the Committee on Homeland Security.
""It is about time we ramp up our efforts to show China that compromising us will no longer be acceptable,"" he told Reuters.

In February, two U.S. Senators introduced the Decoupling from Foreign Adversarial Battery Dependence Act, banning the Department of Homeland Security from purchasing batteries from some Chinese entities, starting October 2027, due to national security concerns.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on March 11 and has yet to be enacted.
THE REAL BREAKTHROUGH IN U.S.–CHINA TRADE TALKS IS MUCH BIGGER THAN JUST TARIFFS
It aims to prevent Homeland Security from procuring batteries from six Chinese companies Washington says are closely linked to the Chinese Communist Party: Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL), BYD Company, Envision Energy, EVE Energy Company, Hithium Energy Storage Technology Company, and Gotion High-tech Company.
None of the companies responded to requests for comment.
Utilities are now preparing for similar bans on Chinese inverter manufacturers, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
Some utilities, including Florida's largest power supplier, Florida Power & Light Company, are attempting to minimize the use of Chinese inverters by sourcing equipment from elsewhere, according to two people familiar with the matter. FPL did not respond to requests for comment.
The DOE spokesperson said: ""As more domestic manufacturing takes hold, DOE is working across the federal government to strengthen U.S. supply chains, providing additional opportunities to integrate trusted equipment into the power grid.""
Huawei is the world's largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
German solar developer 1Komma5 said, however, that it avoids Huawei inverters, because of the brand's associations with security risks.
""Ten years ago, if you switched off the Chinese inverters, it would not have caused a dramatic thing to happen to European grids, but now the critical mass is much larger,"" 1Komma5 Chief Executive Philipp Schroeder said.
""China's dominance is becoming a bigger issue because of the growing renewables capacity on Western grids and the increased likelihood of a prolonged and serious confrontation between China and the West,"" he said.
Since 2019, the U.S. has restricted Huawei's access to U.S. technology, accusing the company of activities contrary to national security, which Huawei denies.
CHINESE IMPORTS TO US PLUMMET TO LOWEST LEVELS SINCE PANDEMIC AMID TRUMP TARIFFS
Chinese companies are required by law to cooperate with China's intelligence agencies, giving the government potential control over Chinese-made inverters connected to foreign grids, experts said.
While Huawei decided to leave the U.S. inverter market in 2019 - the year its 5G telecoms equipment was banned - it remains a dominant supplier elsewhere.
Huawei declined to comment.
In Europe, exercising control over just 3 to 4 gigawatts of energy could cause widespread disruption to electricity supplies, experts said.
The European Solar Manufacturing Council estimates over 200 GW of European solar power capacity is linked to inverters made in China - equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.
At the end of last year, there was 338 GW of installed solar power in Europe, according to industry association SolarPower Europe.
""If you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time,"" said Uri Sadot, cybersecurity program director at Israeli inverter manufacturer SolarEdge.
Other countries such as Lithuania and Estonia acknowledge the threats to energy security. In November, the Lithuanian government passed a law blocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind and battery installations above 100 kilowatts - by default restricting the use of Chinese inverters.
Energy minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas said this could be extended to smaller rooftop solar installations.
Estonia's Director General of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Kaupo Rosin, said the country could be at risk of blackmail from China if it did not ban Chinese technology in crucial parts of the economy, such as solar inverters.
Estonia's Ministries of Defense and Climate declined to comment when asked if they had taken any action.
In Britain, the government's review of Chinese renewable energy technology in the energy system - due to be concluded in the coming months - includes looking at inverters, a person familiar with the matter said.
In November, solar power inverters in the U.S. and elsewhere were disabled from China, highlighting the risk of foreign influence over local electricity supplies and causing concern among government officials, three people familiar with the matter said.
Reuters was unable to determine how many inverters were switched off, or the extent of disruption to grids. The DOE declined to comment on the incident.
Plants grow through an array of solar panels in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 6, 2022. (Reuters/Brian Snyder/File Photo)
The incident led to a commercial dispute between inverter suppliers Sol-Ark and Deye, the people said.
""Sol-Ark does not comment on vendor relationships, including any relationship with Deye, nor does it have any control over inverters that are not branded Sol-Ark, as was the case in the November 2024 situation you referenced,"" a Sol-Ark spokesperson said.
Deye did not respond to requests for comment.
The energy sector is trailing other industries such as telecoms and semiconductors, where regulations have been introduced in Europe and the U.S. to mitigate China's dominance.
Security analysts say this is partly because decisions about whether to secure energy infrastructure are mostly dictated by the size of any installation.

Household solar or battery storage systems fall below thresholds where security requirements typically kick-in, they said, despite now contributing a significant share of power on many Western grids.
NATO, the 32-country Western security alliance, said China's efforts to control member states' critical infrastructure - including inverters - were intensifying.
""We must identify strategic dependencies and take steps to reduce them,"" said a NATO official.

President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would skip Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul and downplayed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision not to attend.
The president had pressed for Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to meet in Istanbul. But speaking at a business roundtable with executives in Doha as part of a four-day tour of the region, Trump said he wasn’t going because of scheduling conflicts.
""I actually said, why would he go if I’m not going?"" Trump said when asked by a reporter if he was disappointed by Putin’s decision not to attend the peace talks. ""I didn't think it was possible for Putin to go if I'm not there.""
Trump earlier this week floated the idea of potentially attending himself. But he noted during the business roundtable that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was already in Istanbul for meetings with NATO counterparts. Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, also plans to be in Istanbul on Friday for the anticipated Russia-Ukraine talks.

The push for direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin comes amid a flurry of negotiations aimed at producing a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine.
RUBIO TAKES SOMBER TONE ON RUSSIA-UKRAINE PEACE DEAL: 'CLOSE BUT NOT CLOSE ENOUGH'
Putin was the first to propose restarting direct peace talks Thursday with Ukraine in the Turkish city that straddles Asia and Europe. Zelenskyy challenged the Kremlin leader to meet in Turkey in person.

But the Kremlin has said its delegation at the talks will be led by Putin's aide, Vladimir Medinsky, and include three other officials. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelenskyy will only sit down with the Russian leader.
Speaking in Doha, Trump said the Russia-Ukraine war ""has to stop."" The president lamented the lives lost and money spent on the war effort.
""We spent $350 billion there – just handed. Nobody even knows where the money is. There’s no accounting. There’s no one. It’s just give him money,"" Trump said, referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
RUBIO DENIES TRUMP IS EXCLUDING UKRAINE FROM RUSSIA TALKS, PUSHES BACK ON NATO CRITICISM
""I have to hand it to him. I think he’s the greatest salesman, maybe in history. Every time he came to the United States, he’d walk away with $100 billion. That’s a good salesman, right?"" Trump said. ""Last time he didn’t do as well. He only got $60 billion.""

Former Hamas hostages are calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Donald Trump and Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff to move quickly to free the remaining hostages, even if it means halting military operations.
After American Israeli Edan Alexander’s release earlier this week, 65 survivors of Hamas captivity urged Netanyahu, Trump and Witkoff to seize the moment and ""not let this historic momentum stop.""

EDAN ALEXANDER'S RELEASE OFFERS ‘WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY’ FOR WIDER HOSTAGE DEAL AMID TRUMP MIDDLE EAST VISIT
On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas took 251 hostages, 12 of whom were American citizens. Keith Siegel, Edan Alexander and Sagui Dekel-Chen have all been released alive. Hersh Goldberg-Polin’s body was taken out of Gaza in August 2023. Hamas is still holding the remains of multiple Americans who have been confirmed dead: Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Judith Weinstein Haggai and Gadi Haggai.

In response to a request for comment, the White House referred Fox News Digital to the comments Trump made while in Saudi Arabia.
""In Gaza, my administration shares the hope of so many in this region for a future of safety and dignity of the Palestinian people. But that cannot happen as long as Gaza's leaders take delight in raping, torturing, and murdering innocent people. Can't have it.I greatly appreciate the constructive role that the leaders in this room have played in trying to bring the terrible conflict to an end, including by helping secure the release of American hostage Edan Alexander. It was a big day yesterday. Very important day. I was told just before I left that they were going to be releasing Edan.  We thought Edan was dead.  Three weeks ago, they said Edan was no longer living.  And it was a very, very good thing. Ultimately, all hostages of all nationalities must be released as a stepping stone to peace, and I think it's going to be happening. A lot of things are happening. A lot of very positive things are happening on every front.""
While in the Middle East in the days after Alexander’s release, Trump has worked on making deals for the U.S., many of which could also benefit Israel, though the latest slate of deals seems to be unrelated to the remaining hostages.
The president asked Syria to join the Abraham Accords and normalize ties with Israel in exchange for sanctions relief. Additionally, Trump said Damascus would need to deport ""Palestinian terrorists,"" help the U.S. prevent the resurgence of ISIS and assume charge of ISIS detention centers in northeast Syria.
Netanyahu’s office declined to comment on the letter.

The straight-talking Mujica, known to many Uruguayans by his nickname ""Pepe,"" led the small farming country's leftist government from 2010 to 2015 after convincing voters his radical past was a closed chapter.
FORMER URUGUAYAN PRESIDENT JOSE MUJICA ANNOUNCES ESOPHAGEAL CANCER DIAGNOSIS
""It is with deep sorrow that we announce the death of our comrade Pepe Mujica,"" President Yamandu Orsi said in a post on X. ""Thank you for everything you gave us and for your deep love for your people.""
As president, Mujica adopted what was then a pioneering liberal stance on issues related to civil liberties. He signed a law allowing gay marriage and abortions in early pregnancy, and backed a proposal to legalize marijuana sales. The gay marriage and abortion measures were a big shift for Catholic Latin America, and the move on marijuana was at the time almost unprecedented worldwide.
Regional leaders, including leftist presidents in Brazil, Chile and Mexico, mourned Mujica's passing and praised his example.
""He defended democracy like few others. And he never stopped advocating for social justice and the end of all inequalities,"" said Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Mujica's ""greatness transcended the borders of Uruguay and his presidential term,"" he added.
During his term in office, Mujica refused to move to the presidential residence, choosing to stay in his modest home where he kept a small flower farm in a suburb of Montevideo, the capital.
Shunning a formal suit and tie, it was common to see him driving around in his Beetle or eating at downtown restaurants where office workers had lunch.

In a May 2024 interview with Reuters in the tin-roofed house that Mujica shared with his wife, former Senator Lucia Topolansky, he said he had kept the old Beetle and that it was still in ""phenomenal"" condition.
But, he added, he preferred a turn on the tractor, saying it was ""more entertaining"" than a car and was a place where ""you have time to think.""
Critics questioned Mujica's tendency to break with protocol, while his blunt and occasionally uncouth statements sometimes forced him to explain himself, under pressure from opponents and political allies alike.
But it was his down-to-earth style and progressive musings that endeared him to many Uruguayans.
""The problem is that the world is run by old people, who forget what they were like when they were young,"" Mujica said during the 2024 interview.
Mujica himself was 74 when he became president. He was elected with 52% of the vote, despite some voters' concerns about his age and his past as one of the leaders of the Tupamaros rebel group in the 1960s and 1970s.
Lucia Topolansky was Mujica's long-term partner, dating back to their days in the Tupamaros. The couple married in 2005, and she served as vice president from 2017-2020.
After leaving office, they remained politically active, regularly attending inaugurations of Latin American presidents and giving crucial backing to candidates in Uruguay, including Orsi, who took office in March 2025. They stopped growing flowers on their small holding but continued to cultivate vegetables, including tomatoes that Topolansky pickled each season.
BEHIND BARS
Jose Mujica's birth certificate recorded him as born in 1935, although he claimed there was an error and that he was actually born a year earlier. He once described his upbringing as ""dignified poverty.""
Mujica's father died when he was 9 or 10 years old, and as a boy he helped his mother maintain the farm where they grew flowers and kept chickens and a few cows.
At the time Mujica became interested in politics, Uruguay's left was weak and fractured and he began his political career in a progressive wing of the center-right National Party.
In the late 1960s, he joined the Marxist Tupamaros guerrilla movement, which sought to weaken Uruguay's conservative government through robberies, political kidnappings and bombings.
Mujica later said that he had never killed anyone but was involved in several violent clashes with police and soldiers and was once shot six times.
Uruguay's security forces gained the upper hand over the Tupamaros by the time the military swept to power in a 1973 coup, marking the start of a 12-year dictatorship in which about 200 people were kidnapped and killed. Thousands more were jailed and tortured.
Mujica spent almost 15 years behind bars, many in solitary confinement, lying at the bottom of an old horse trough with only ants for company. He managed to escape twice, once by tunneling into a nearby house. His biggest ""vice"" as he approached 90, he later said, was talking to himself, alluding to his time in isolation.
When democracy was restored to the farming country of roughly 3 million people in 1985, Mujica was released and returned to politics, gradually becoming a prominent figure on the left.
He served as agriculture minister in the center-left coalition of his predecessor, President Tabaré Vázquez, who would go on to succeed him from 2015 to 2020.
Mujica's support base was on the left, but he maintained a fluid dialogue with opponents within the center-right, inviting them to traditional barbecues at his home.
""We can't pretend to agree on everything. We have to agree with what there is, not with what we like,"" he said.
He believed drugs should be decriminalized ""under strict state control"" and addiction addressed.
""I do not defend drug use. But I can't defend (a ban) because now we have two problems: drug addiction, which is a disease, and narcotrafficking, which is worse,"" he said.

In retirement, he remained resolutely optimistic.
""I want to convey to all the young people that life is beautiful, but it wears out and you fall,"" he said following a cancer diagnosis.
""The point is to start over every time you fall, and if there is anger, transform it into hope.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-revisits-killer-robot-regulations-concerns-about-ai-controlled-weapons-grow","UN revisits 'killer robot' regulations as concerns about AI-controlled weapons grow","The CyberGuy Kurt Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the U.S.-Saudi investment summit and the debate over regulation as artificial intelligence continues to advance.
Several nations met at the United Nations (U.N.) on Monday to revisit a topic that the international body has been discussing for over a decade: the lack of regulations on lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS), often referred to as ""killer robots.""
This latest round of talks comes as wars rage in Ukraine and Gaza.
While the meeting was held behind closed doors, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres released a statement doubling down on his 2026 deadline for a legally binding solution to threats posed by LAWS.
""Machines that have the power and discretion to take human lives without human control are politically unacceptable, morally repugnant and should be banned by international law,"" Guterres said in a statement. ""We cannot delegate life-or-death decisions to machines,"" he later added.

FORMER TRUMP OFFICIAL SLAMS UN REFORM EFFORTS AS 'EIGHT AND A HALF YEARS LATE'
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) President Mirjana Spoljaric delivered a statement to nations participating in Monday's meeting. Spoljaric expressed the ICRC’s support for efforts to regulate LAWS but warned that technology is evolving faster than regulations, making threats posed by the systems ""more worrying.""
""Machines with the power and discretion to take lives without human involvement threaten to transform warfare in ways with grave humanitarian consequences. They also raise fundamental ethical and human rights concerns. All humanity will be affected,"" Spoljaric said.

NUCLEAR WATCHDOG URGES 'TRUST BUT VERIFY' THAT IRAN ENGAGES IN GOOD-FAITH NEGOTIATIONS
Artificial intelligence is not necessarily a prerequisite for something to be considered an autonomous weapon, according to the U.N., as not all autonomous systems fully rely on AI. Some can use pre-programmed functions for certain tasks. However, AI ""could further enable"" autonomous weapons systems, the U.N. said.
Vice President of the Conservative Partnership Institute Rachel Bovard, however, says that while regulation of autonomous weapons is necessary, the U.S. needs to be cautious when it comes to the development of international law.
""AI is the wild west and every country is trying to determine the rules of the road. Some regulation will be imperative to preserving our humanity. When it comes to international law, however, the U.S. should proceed with caution,"" Bovard told Fox News Digital. ""As we have learned with everything from trade to health, subjecting our national sovereignty to international dictates can have lasting unintended consequences. If existing international law is sufficient at the moment, that is what should govern.""

Countries in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons have been meeting since 2014 to discuss a possible full ban on LAWS that operate without human control and to regulate those with more human involvement, according to Reuters.
In 2023, more than 160 nations backed a U.N. resolution calling on countries across the globe to address the risks posed by LAWS. However, there is currently no international law specifically regulating LAWS.

Pope Leo XIV made his first social media post on Tuesday in which he sent a message of peace, as he seeks to maintain an active social media presence through the official papal accounts.
The pontiff has chosen ""to maintain an active social media presence through the official papal accounts on X and Instagram,"" the Dicastery for Communication said in a press release.
In his first post since taking over the Vatican’s official Instagram and X accounts, he repeated the first words he said to the world as pope.

""Peace be with you all!"" he began in an Instagram post.
The post featured some of the photos showing the first days of his time as the new pope, after he took over from his predecessor, Pope Francis, who died last month at the age of 88.
""This is the first greeting spoken by the Risen Christ, the Good Shepherd,"" the Instagram post continued. ""I would like this greeting of peace to resound in your hearts, in your families, and among all people, wherever they may be, in every nation and throughout the world.""

It had been inactive since July 2023 before he returned to the platform earlier this year to criticize the Trump administration's immigration policies and comments by Vice President JD Vance, who had also been at odds with Francis in his final months over the administration's immigration agenda that included a mass deportation plan.

President Donald Trump, speaking at the Gulf Cooperation Council in Riyadh on Wednesday, reiterated his desire to make a deal with Iran and called for building upon the progress of the Abraham Accords by adding more countries to the historic agreement.
Trump made the comments while addressing leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council as part of his four-day visit to the region.
""I want to make a deal with Iran. I want to do something if possible. But for that to happen, it must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars, and permanently and verifiably cease its pursuit of nuclear weapons. They cannot have a nuclear weapon,"" Trump said.

Trump praised the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain for ""their vision and courage in signing the historic Abraham Accords,"" an agreement brokered by the U.S. in 2020. As part of the agreements, the UAE and Bahrain recognized Israel’s sovereignty and established full diplomatic relations. It marked the first time Israel had established peace with an Arab country since 1994, with the Israel-Jordan peace treaty.
""In the future, we’ll continue that progress by adding more countries to the Abraham Accords,"" Trump said.

The remarks, made just moments after Trump met with Syria’s Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on the sidelines, came a day after Trump announced his administration was lifting sanctions on Syria.
Trump also said that Lebanon had a ""new chance for a future free from the grip of Hezbollah terrorists if the new president and prime minister can rebuild an effective Lebanese state.""

The U.S. State Department announced it has approved a potential sale of more than $1.4 billion in helicopters and F-16 fighter jet parts to the United Arab Emirates, just ahead of President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle Eastern nation.
The proposed sale includes $1.32 billion for CH-47 F Chinook helicopters and $130 million for F-16s parts, the State Department said on Monday.
The agency has notified Congress of the proposed sale, although some Democrats have previously signaled they may be hesitant to give the green light to such a sale.
This comes as Trump is expected to travel to the UAE later this week for the final stop on his four-day trip to the Middle East. He is also visiting Saudi Arabia and Qatar on his first major international trip of his second administration.

The UAE has already vowed to spend $1.4 trillion in U.S. investments over the next decade, which are expected to focus on semiconductors, manufacturing, energy and artificial intelligence.
Arms transfers and defense trade are overseen by the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency and the State Department.
The State Department first reviews deals wanted by other countries to ensure they meet the U.S. government's goals. If approved, the agency notifies Congress of the sale. Federal lawmakers may reject a proposed sale, but if they elect not to, the U.S. government proceeds to negotiations.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said on Monday ahead of the State Department's announcement that he would ""block any arms sale to a nation that is doing direct personal business with Trump,"" citing the UAE-backed investment firm putting $2 billion into Trump’s crypto venture and the U.S. president's administration accepting Qatar’s gift of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet to serve as Air Force One.

""We should have a full Senate debate and vote,"" Murphy wrote on X. ""UAE’s investment in Trump crypto and Qatar’s gifting of a plane is nuclear grade graft. An unacceptable corruption of our foreign policy.""
""Normally, arms sales go forward without a vote,"" he continued. ""But any Senator can object and force a full debate and Senate vote. I will do that for any military deal with a nation that is paying off Trump personally. We can't act like this is normal foreign policy.""
In January, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., expressed opposition to a $1.2 billion arms sale to the UAE, pointing to the country providing weapons to the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan, which the U.S. has accused of war crimes and ethnic cleansing.

Congress has previously attempted to block Trump from completing arms sales to Gulf nations, including in 2019 during his first term, when lawmakers placed holds on deals with Saudi Arabia and the UAE over concerns about civilian casualties in the war in Yemen, as the Saudi coalition has been accused of being responsible for the majority of civilian deaths.
However, Trump has invoked a provision allowing sales to go through immediately without a review period in cases considered an emergency.

The self-styled ""king"" of Germany and three of his senior ""subjects"" were arrested for attempting to overthrow the state, according to media reports.
Peter Fitzek, 59, was taken into police custody during morning raids conducted Tuesday in seven German states, the BBC reported.
Fitzek's group, the Reichsbürger, or ""citizens of the Reich,"" has also been banned by the government.

The group's aim is to establish the Königreich Deutschland, or ""Kingdom of Germany.""
""I have no interest in being part of this fascist and satanic system,"" Fitzek previously told the news outlet in a 2022 interview.
Reichsbürgers reportedly have their own currency, flag and identification cards and want to set up separate banking and health systems.
The Reichsbürger undermined ""the rule of law,"" said Alexander Dobrindt, Germany's interior minister, by creating an alternative state and spreading ""antisemitic conspiracy narratives to back up their supposed claim to authority,"" the news report states.

Fitzek, who claims to have thousands of ""subjects,"" denied having violent intentions but also called Germany ""destructive and sick.""
In 2022, dozens of people associated with the Reichsbürger were arrested for plotting to overthrow the German government in Berlin. They were accused of planning a violent coup, which included kidnapping the health minister in an effort to create ""civil war conditions"" to bring down German democracy, according to the BBC.

Though Trump said he wants to make a deal with Iran and see Tehran prosper, his comments came after he first went after the Iranian regime and accused it of not only deteriorating its own nation, but the region at large.
""Iran's leaders have focused on stealing their people's wealth to fund terror and bloodshed abroad. Most tragic of all, they have dragged down an entire region with them,"" Trump said.
The president pointed to the ""countless lives lost"" in Iran’s effort to prop up the former Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria – which collapsed in December – and accused its support of Hezbollah for the downfall of Beirut, which he said was ""once called the Paris of the Middle East.""

Trump asserted the Biden administration’s removal of some sanctions on Tehran as the chief method in how Iran financed terrorist organizations, including Hamas, which he argued led to the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel.
Fox News Digital reached out to a spokesperson for President Joe Biden for comment on Trump's claims.
""If only the Iranian regime had focused on building their nation up instead of tearing the region down,"" Trump continued. ""Yet I'm here today not merely to condemn the past chaos of Iran's leaders, but to offer them a new path and a much better path toward a far better and more hopeful future.
""In the case of Iran, I have never believed in having permanent enemies,"" he said. ""Enemies get you motivated.

President Donald Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for his first major overseas trip since retaking office, hoping to secure major deals on trade and diplomatic breakthroughs across the Middle East.
The president is now expected to meet with Syria’s interim president on Wednesday, with some analysts predicting the meeting could result in a big diplomatic win for Trump.
""This is a historic opportunity, and it would be a shame if the U.S. lost it,"" Natasha Hall, senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told Fox News Digital.
President Trump seems open to renewed relations with Syria, including the possibility of lifting crippling sanctions imposed under the previous regime of Bashar al-Assad.

""We may take them off of Syria, because we want to give them a fresh start,"" President Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday.
The president added that ""we want to see if we can help them out"" and that a determination on Syria sanctions will be made at some point.
""Syria now, for the first time, has a government in power that is not only no longer reliant on Iran to survive but is quite hostile to Iran, and so that would be a big opportunity lost if the U.S. didn’t step up,"" Hall added.

Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a non-profit helping to bring democracy to Syria, recently met with Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus.
Moustafa exclusively told Fox News Digital that the two spoke for over three hours about a potential breakthrough in U.S.-Syrian relations, which have been severed since 2011 following the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, which led to the deaths of over 500,000 people.
Moustafa and others are pushing for a meeting between al-Sharaa and President Trump during his visit to the Gulf this week. For Syria’s new government, this will be their opportunity to persuade the new administration to do business with a country coming out of a devastating 13-year civil war and mend ties with a leader who was once aligned with the Islamic State and al Qaeda.
""Syria’s objectives are quite clear on why they would want to meet President Trump in Saudi Arabia, to make headway on some of these core issues of cooperation and to alleviate any of the concerns the White House may have. And some of the things they’ve been trying to do is to show that they can be cooperative on intelligence issues, on business, and talking about companies seeking to do business in Syria,"" CSIS’ Hall said.
SYRIA'S NEW REGIME HITS HEZBOLLAH TARGETS IN LEBANON OVER CLAIMS ITS FIGHTERS WERE EXECUTED
Yet others urge caution. ""Right now, Sharaa is not restricting political and civil liberties, but he's an authoritarian by nature."" former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford told Fox News Digital.
Ford, who was the last U.S. ambassador in Damascus, was pulled from the embassy in October 2011 after the Syrian uprising turned violent. Ford led the effort to put al-Sharaa on the terrorist list in 2012 and said, although he is pragmatic, he is leading an extremely weak government.
""He doesn’t control all of Syria yet. The government in Damascus that he leads is not very strong, and it will take time to reassert all of its authority over Syria,"" Ford said.
Ford does not believe al-Sharaa will pursue terrorism as he did in the past, but while there have been some promising developments since taking power, the U.S. must keep its expectations relatively low.
""Syria is so weak, militarily and economically, with lots of internal political divisions. Therefore, it's not going to be in a position to sign huge arrangements with the U.S.,"" Ford cautioned.
A senior official in the Syrian Foreign Ministry told Fox News Digital that President al-Sharaa emphasizes ""that the new Free Syria seeks to establish a strong strategic relationship with the United States, one grounded in mutual interests and shared partnership.""

The senior official added that ""Damascus sees U.S. President Donald Trump as the leader most capable of achieving peace in the Middle East,"" noting that Syria hopes to become an active and influential ally to Washington on regional issues.
Moustafa also met with members of the National Security Council and conveyed the Syrian president's desire for a new partnership.
The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.
The new Syrian leader has already shown a willingness to cooperate on some key issues important to the U.S. The new Syrian government has cooperated with U.S. intelligence agencies and foiled several ISIS plots to attack Damascus. Syrian intelligence services also arrested ISIS commander Abu al-Harith al-Iraqi in February.

Moustafa also said that al-Sharaa was worried about the massive buildup of Iranian-backed militias along the Iraqi side of the Syrian border. This is a worry for the U.S. as well as the Trump administration, he said, as it has been looking to reengage with Iran to curb its nuclear program.
In al-Sharaa’s eyes, the deal of the century would bring peace to Syria and its neighbors, including Israel. Moustafa added the deal would keep China, Russia and Iran out and allow U.S. troops to go home in the right way.
Yet critics warn a potential deal with the United States is not without its obstacles.

Al-Sharaa led the Islamist rebel group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) to victory over the Assad dictatorship in December. He had a $10 million bounty for his capture that was lifted in February amidst the administration’s efforts to talk to the new Syrian government.

HTS is still a designated foreign terrorist organization, which complicates doing business in Syria.
""The question at hand is whether to believe that a change in behavior, following the fall of the regime, translates into a more permanent change in character, ideology, and governance,"" Caroline Rose, director of The New Lines Institute, told Fox News Digital.

Rose, who recently traveled to Syria, noted that while HTS has been incrementally breaking away from affiliations with terrorist organizations and has adopted some moderate elements over time, there are still doubts that this will ""stick,"" particularly with recent sectarian tensions.
""Skeptics of lifting restrictions on Syria immediately fear that any move could be too premature and could risk the U.S.’ credibility among its regional counterparts,"" Rose added.
Since becoming president, al-Sharaa has formed a transitional government composed of close allies from the HTS rebel group and a mix of technocrats, former opposition leaders, civil society activists and even some former members of the Assad government.
The temporary constitution signed by al-Sharaa in March guarantees basic freedoms such as freedoms of opinion, expression and the press. It also protects women’s rights and promises equal rights for all Syrians regardless of ethnicity, religious sect or gender, yet it still leaves the country under Islamist rule during the transitional process.
There remain some concerns over the power concentrated in the hands of the president. The president can unilaterally declare a state of emergency and suspend basic rights if national security is threatened.

The vast powers granted to the executive in the new constitution is a reminder for many Syrians of the authoritarian past many suffered at the hands of the Assad regime for over 50 years.
Although there is a new sense of optimism within Syrian society about its future, civil peace and security remain elusive.
Deadly sectarian clashes in March launched by remnants of the former Assad regime in Syria’s coastal region led to the deaths of 200 members of the security forces. Forces allied with the government and armed civilians responded with brute force. The Syrian Network for Human Rights reported that these groups were responsible for the deaths of at least 396 people.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/french-actor-gerard-depardieu-found-guilty-sexual-assault-given-18-month-suspended-sentence","French actor Gérard Depardieu found guilty of sexual assault, given 18-month suspended sentence","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.
French movie star Gérard Depardieu was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on the set of a movie in which he starred, and was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence by a Paris court on Tuesday.
He was also fined a total of 29,040 euros (around $32,350), and the court requested that he be registered in the national sex offender database.
The 76-year-old actor was convicted of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during the filming of ""Les Volets Verts"" (""The Green Shutters"") in 2021. The case was widely seen as a key post-#MeToo test of how French society and its film industry address allegations of sexual misconduct involving prominent figures.
FRENCH ACTOR GÉRARD DEPARDIEU CHARGED WITH ALLEGED RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT FROM 2018 CASE
Depardieu, who has denied the accusations, didn't attend the hearing in Paris. Depardieu’s lawyer said that his client would appeal the decision.
""It is the victory of two women, but it is the victory of all the women beyond this trial,"" said Carine Durrieu Diebolt, the set dresser's lawyer. ""Today we hope to see the end of impunity for an artist in the world of cinema. I think that with this decision we can no longer say that he is not a sexual abuser. And today, as the Cannes Film Festival opens, I’d like the film world to spare a thought for Gérard Depardieu’s victims.""

Depardieu’s long and storied career — he told the court that he’s made more than 250 films — has turned him into a French movie giant. He was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as the swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.
In recent years, the actor has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some other cases were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.
During the four-day trial in March, Depardieu rejected the accusations, saying he’s ""not like that."" He acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language on the film set and that he grabbed the set dresser's hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.
JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME HITS BACK AT 'GROTESQUE' SEX TRAFFICKING ALLEGATIONS
The court, composed of a panel of three judges, concluded that Depardieu’s explanations in court were ""unpersuasive"" and ""not credible"" and stressed both accusers' ""constant, reiterated and substantiated declarations.""
The court also said that both plaintiffs have been faced with an ""aggressive"" defense strategy ""based on comments meant to offend them."" The judges therefore considered that Depardieu’s lawyer's comments in court aggravated the harm to the accusers and justified higher fines.
Depardieu’s lawyer, Jérémie Assous, regretted that the court ""considered that questioning the accusations is an additional assault ... which means that now the defense, even in this type of trial, is no longer accepted.""

(AP Photo/Thomas Padilla)
The set dresser described the alleged assault, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.
She said he grabbed her hips, then started ""palpating"" her behind and ""in front, around."" She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then grabbed her chest.
The woman also testified that Depardieu used an obscene expression to ask her to touch his penis and suggested he wanted to rape her. She told the court that the actor’s calm and cooperative attitude during the trial bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.
FRENCHMAN FOUND GUILTY IN HORRIFIC RAPE TRIAL THAT SHOCKED THE WORLD
The other plaintiff, an assistant, said that Depardieu groped her buttocks and her breasts during three separate incidents on the film set.
The Associated Press doesn’t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to be named. Neither woman has done so in this case, although one has agreed to be pictured.
""I’m very moved,"" one of the plaintiffs, the set dresser, told reporters after the verdict. ""I’m very, very much satisfied with the decision, that’s a victory for me, really, and a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.""

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus, File)
Some figures in the French cinema world have expressed their support for Depardieu. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.
French media reported last week that Depardieu was shooting a film directed by Ardant in the Azores archipelago, in Portugal.
The actor may have to face other legal proceedings soon.
In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024 prosecutors requested that it go to trial.
For more than a half-century, Depardieu stood as a towering figure in French cinema, a titan known for his commanding physical presence, instinct, sensibility and remarkable versatility.

A bon vivant who overcame a speech impediment and a turbulent youth, Depardieu rose to prominence in the 1970s and became one of France’s most prolific and acclaimed actors, portraying a vast array of characters, from volatile outsiders to deeply introspective figures.
In recent years, his behavior toward women has come under renewed scrutiny, including after a documentary showed him repeatedly making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday pledged to move against Hamas with ""full force"" in the coming days to ""complete"" the fight against the Iran-backed terror group.
Netanyahu made the remarks about the war in Gaza while visiting with Israel Defense Forces reservists.
""In the coming days, we are going in with full force to complete the operation,"" Netanyahu said. ""Completing the operation means defeating Hamas. It means destroying Hamas.""
Netanyahu said that eliminating Hamas and freeing the remaining hostages that the group took during its deadly attack on Oct. 7, 2023, ""go hand in hand.""

""It’s possible that Hamas will say, ‘Time out — we want to release ten more [hostages].’ Fine, bring them. We’ll take them, and then we’ll go in,"" the prime minister said. ""But there will not be a situation in which we stop the war. There may be a temporary cease-fire, but we’re going all the way.""
With Hamas' release of Israeli American hostage Edan Alexander on Monday, there are 58 hostages now being held in Gaza. Netanyahu's remarks came just before Alexander was released.

British police arrested a 21-year-old suspect Tuesday after the private London home of United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer was targeted by a ""suspicious"" fire, reports say.
The Metropolitan Police said the suspect was detained on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life a day after an early-morning fire on Monday damaged the door of the house where Starmer and his family lived before he was elected to lead the country, according to the Associated Press.
""As a precaution and due to the property having previous connections with a high-profile public figure, officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command are leading the investigation into this fire. Enquiries are ongoing to establish what caused it,"" the Met Police said in a statement.
Police said that the arrest also concerns two other fires that may be linked — a vehicle fire near Starmer's house on Sunday and a May 8 door fire at a property in another part of north London. The second property is a house converted into apartments and also is linked to Starmer.

No injuries were reported from any of the fires.
Starmer doesn't currently live in his private house. Since taking office in July, Starmer has lived with his family in the prime minister’s official Downing Street residence.

American and Israeli officials believe the release of Edan Alexander, 21, presents a ""window of opportunity"" to free the remaining 58 hostages still held by Hamas after 585 days since their capture on Oct. 7, 2023.
Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and hostage envoy Adam Boehler will travel from Israel to Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday for further negotiations for the release of not only the 24 hostages still believed to be alive, but also the bodies of at least 34 individuals who have been held by the terrorist group including four Americans: Itay Chen, Omer Neutra, and Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai.
In a nearly two-hour meeting with Witkoff, Boehler and the Hostages Families Forum, both officials emphasized that they remain committed to returning all hostages and confirmed they would not be traveling to Doha if they did not believe there was a real chance in advancing negotiations.

AMERICAN HOSTAGE EDAN ALEXANDER RELEASED BY HAMAS AFTER MORE THAN 580 DAYS IN CAPTIVITY
While Alexander's return has been championed as a major success story, and both President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were reported to have spoken with the Israeli American from a hospital in Tel Aviv, immense concern remains over the hostages still held in the Gaza Strip.
Though Israel ceased its military operations in the Gaza Strip to secure the safe transport of Alexander on Monday, it has not committed to any continued cessation of strikes.
In Witkoff’s comments to the families of the hostages, he said President Trump would not ""tolerate anything other than everybody coming home, and he will be relentless in that pursuit."" He continued, ""you saw what happened with the Houthis. You saw what happened when people don't do well with the United States, we don't do so well with them. So it's a message of do what we ask you to do. And you know then things will be better.""
Israeli reports also suggested the envoy may be feeling frustrated with his Israeli counterparts.
""We want to bring the hostages home, but Israel is not willing to end the war. Israel is prolonging it despite the fact that we don’t see where else we can go and that an agreement must be reached,"" Witkoff reportedly said during the meeting with the hostage families.
""There is currently a window of opportunity that we hope Israel and all the mediators will take advantage of,"" he was reported to have added. ""We are putting pressure on all the mediators and doing everything we can to bring the hostages home.""
The comments reportedly come following reports that Trump has also grown increasingly frustrated with his Israeli counterpart.

Israel said last week that Trump’s visit to the Middle East would be ""the window of opportunity"" to secure a ceasefire otherwise it would continue with its newly announced plans to capture all of Gaza, despite immense international pushback and concerns over human rights abuses and violations of U.N.-established borders.
The comments came after Netanyahu prompted immense outcry after he said his number one priority was destroying Hamas, not returning the hostages, despite opposition to the plan by the majority of Israelis.
On Monday, Netanyahu reiterated his intent to ""destroy"" Hamas while speaking with injured reservists and confirmed that even if Hamas agrees to return the hostages, Israel will continue with its military operations.

He was kidnapped on the morning of October 7 – a Saturday when he wasn’t required to remain on base. His mother was visiting from abroad, and like many lone soldiers he had the option to go home for the weekend. He chose to stay, not wanting to leave his fellow soldiers short-staffed on guard duty.
Ayelet Samerano, the mother of hostage Yonatan Samerano, said Monday that the previous day was Mother's Day, and how ""[a]round the world, mothers celebrated with their children.""

""But for me – and the other mothers of the 59 hostages – it was just another day of nightmare. Yes, I am happy for the Alexander family. They will finally have their son Edan back. I thank President Trump and Steve Witkoff for this progress,"" she added. ""But President Trump – please don't stop. This is only the first step. Do whatever is necessary to bring every last one home. The other 58 hostages have no time left. They are in hell. The living could be killed any day. The deceased – their bodies could be lost forever. They must all come home.""

The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) announced on Monday that it will disband and disarm following its more than four-decade insurgency against the Turkish state that has resulted in the deaths of over 40,000 people at the hands of PKK militants and Turkey’s military.
The PKK has sought to create an independent Kurdish state on Turkish soil, where the Kurds make up some 20% of Turkey's 86 million population. The U.S., the European Union and Turkey have classified the PKK as a terrorist organization.
In its statement, the PKK said, according to a Reuters report, it ""has completed its historic mission,"" which over the years shifted to seeking greater Kurdish rights and limited autonomy in southeast Turkey, rather than an independent state.
TURKISH DRONE STRIKES IN SYRIA KILL 4 U.S.-BACKED FIGHTERS, WOUND 11 CIVILIANS, KURDISH GROUP SAYS
Supporters cheer President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at an election rally in Ankara, Turkey, on June 5, 2015.
""The PKK struggle has broken the policy of denial and annihilation of our people and brought the Kurdish issue to a point of solving it through democratic politics,"" it said on the Firat news website, which showed images of senior PKK members attending the congress in fighter fatigues.
Turkey will take necessary measures to ensure smooth progress toward a ""terror-free"" country after the PKK decision, said Turkey’s presidential communications director, Fahrettin Altun.
The dissolution of the PKK raises a host of questions for the Islamist government of Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the pro-American Kurdish forces (YPG) in northern Syrian who helped defeat the Islamist State terrorist movement. Turkey considers the YPG an affiliate of the PKK and has repeatedly launched military strikes against Syrian Kurds.

TURKEY'S INVASION THREATS SHOULD BE TAKEN 'VERY SERIOUSLY': CYPRUS OFFICIAL
The jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has been held on an island south of Istanbul since 1999, urged in February that the PKK disband.
Separately, Mazloum Abdi, the pro-American commander in chief of Syrian Kurdish fighters, called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which ousted the Islamic State, said Ocalan’s call did not apply to his organization. The YPG is part of the larger umbrella organization, the SDF, and is not associated with the PKK.

The U.S. and the EU are allied with the SDF and the YPG in the fight against Islamist terrorism in Syria and, in contrast to Turkey, do not see an affiliation between the SDF, YPG and the PKK.
Fox News Digital has reported over the years on Turkey’s efforts to wipe out pro-U.S. Syrian Kurdish forces (SDF and YPG) who played a key role in the dismantlement of the Islamic State.

More than a ton of cocaine worth nearly $400 million was seized off the coast of Australia during a drug bust that ended with the arrests of five men on Friday, local authorities said.
New South Wales (NSW) Police Force investigators obtained intelligence about a suspicious purchase of a boat with a large sum of cash in late April and began following the movements of the vessel and people involved, the NSW and Australian Federal Police (AFP) said in a joint news release.
Both the NSW and AFP monitored their activities as they traveled north via Nelson Bay and Port Macquarie, according to the agencies.
When the vessel came back to shore on Friday, marine authorities launched an interception.

JERUSALEM — With President Donald Trump set to leave for the Middle East on Monday, talks between the U.S. and the Islamic Republic of Iran concluded a fourth round of negotiations in Oman on Sunday over Tehran’s illicit nuclear weapons program.
Before leaving for his trip, Trump reiterated his stance on Iran's nuclear goals while addressing reporters at the White House, where he said, ""You can't have a nuclear weapon, but I think that they are talking intelligently. We're in the midst of talking to them, and they're right now acting very intelligent. We want Iran to be wealthy and wonderful and happy and great, but they can't have … nuclear weapons. Very simple. So I think they understand that.""
A day before the start of talks, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei welcomed chants of ""Death to America"" in Tehran. ""Your judgment is right,"" Khamenei told a crowd of supporters who called for the destruction of the U.S.
TRUMP HALTS MILITARY STRIKES ON HOUTHIS BUT EXPERT WARNS IRAN-BACKED TERRORIST GROUP REMAINS MAJOR THREAT
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said the nuclear talks were ""difficult but useful."" A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations, offered a little bit more, describing them as being both indirect and direct, The Associated Press reported.
An ""agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements,"" the U.S. official said. ""We are encouraged by today’s outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future.""

President Trump announced a 60-day time frame to reach an agreement with Iran over its illegal atomic weapons program. The first U.S. negotiating session with Iran commenced on April 12.
Mardo Soghom, an Iran analyst and journalist, noted prior to the start of talks several months ago that Iran’s regime will go to great lengths to preserve its right to enrich uranium—the material required for a nuclear weapon. The Trump administration vehemently opposes a uranium enrichment program on Iranian soil.
""Iran is trying to save its enrichment operation at a lower level and also not accepting any pressure to halt its anti-Israel stance. Khamenei's speech [Saturday] highlighted that second point. But at this point, the main issue is dismantling Iran's uranium enrichment,"" Soghom told Fox News Digital.
Khamenei also lashed out at Israel during his Saturday speech in Tehran, declaring about Israel’s war campaign to root out Iran-backed Hamas terrorists from the Gaza Strip that ""The people of Gaza are not facing Israel alone—they are facing America and Britain.""
Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran, told Fox News Digital that ""The Iranians, like last round, sound more downcast than the U.S. side, describing talks as difficult.""
In 2018, President Trump withdrew from former President Barack Obama’s 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), because the accord failed to prevent Tehran from building a nuclear weapons device, according to the first Trump administration.

President Trump’s Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff recently stressed that Iran cannot have an enrichment program during an interview with Breitbart News prior to Sunday’s bargaining session.
Witkoff said ""First of all, we’re never doing a JCPOA deal where sanctions come off and there’s no sunsetting of their obligations. That doesn’t make sense. That was a mismatched procedure in JCPOA. We believe that they cannot have enrichment, they cannot have centrifuges, they cannot have anything that allows them to build a weapon. We believe in all of that. That was not JCPOA. JCPOA had sunset provisions that burned off the obligations and burned off the sanctions relief at inappropriate times. It’s never going to happen in this deal.""
Brodsky said that ""All in all, both sides want to keep the process moving. The Iranians will usually say and do enough to earn another meeting as they stand to lose more by this process breaking down than the U.S. government. The negotiating process is as important to the Iranians as the agreement itself as the process offers insulation from the impact of sanctions—with the rial strengthening since talks started—and protection from a military strike.
""This is why Iran will want these negotiations to continue for as long as possible. They will try to wear out and exhaust U.S. negotiators into concessions, which the Trump administration should reject. As President Trump said in a different context, Tehran does not have the cards here.""

The hot-button issue of uranium enrichment has plagued talks with Iran over the last few decades. The Europeans faced intense criticism when they agreed—independent of the U.S.—to allow the Islamic Republic to enrich uranium during the nascent phase of atomic talks during the early years of this century.
Brodsky said ""The original sin of U.S. decision-making on Iran’s nuclear program was when the Obama administration changed the U.S. position from zero enrichment to tolerating enrichment at 3.67%. That laid the groundwork for Iran to retain the capability to continue to use its nuclear program to extort the United States and ultimately build a nuclear weapon.""
The nuclear expert noted, ""That should end today, and recent comments from President Trump, Special Envoy Witkoff, and Secretary Rubio hopefully signal that this era is over. House and Senate Republicans were also very clear on this point over the last week. The Iranians say they want a durable deal. But a JCPOA 2.0—tolerating enrichment at 3.67% and no dismantlement of nuclear facilities—would not be one.
""The Iranians are engaged in all kinds of gimmicks to dress up a variation of the same concessions they offered to President Obama. That should be unacceptable to American negotiators.""

The anti-American news outlet, Kayhan, that serves as the mouthpiece for Khamenei, published a full-page screed against Trump where it stated, ""He is a framework based on narcissism, superiority delusions, and threat-based tactics.""
The talks on Sunday ran for some three hours in Muscat, the capital of Oman. Iran's regime spokesperson, Baghaei, said that a decision on the next round of talks is under discussion.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/remains-found-syria-do-not-include-those-austin-tice-family-says","Remains found in Syria do not include those of Austin Tice, family says","Debra Tice is back in Syria for the first time for over 10 years searching for her son who has been missing since 2012.
The family of journalist and U.S. Marine Corps veteran Austin Tice, who has been missing in Syria for more than 12 years, said reports that his body has been found are false.
The report initiated in regional media outlets, and appeared briefly on FoxNews.com Sunday. While an international search effort organized by Qatar to find captives once held by ISIS has turned up remains in Syria, there is no evidence that any are Tice’s. Those most familiar with his case say he was not held by ISIS and was not in the area where remains were found. His family said in December that they have strong reason to believe he is alive.
""We appreciate whatever mission is ongoing to help families of ISIS victims find closure,"" said a spokesman for the Tice family. ""However, an initial and erroneous report that Austin Tice was identified among the remains was quickly and completely contradicted.""
Tice, 43, who was a freelancer photographer and journalist, was kidnapped in Damascus in August of 2012. A former captain in the Marines who served in Afghanistan, he had gone to Syria as an independent journalist in May 2012, before his final year at Georgetown Law School. No group has taken credit for his abduction.
The FBI is offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading to Tice’s safe return.

Polish officials ordered the closure of Russia's consulate in Krakow on Monday after an investigation concluded that Moscow was responsible for a 2024 arson that destroyed a shopping center in Warsaw.
Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski announced the closure on Monday and also remarked on the matter during a visit to the U.K. It came after the conclusion of a year-long investigation into a blaze that destroyed a shopping center with some 1,400 stores last year.
""This was a huge fire of a shopping mall in Warsaw in which, just by sheer luck, nobody was hurt. This is completely unacceptable,"" Sikorski said. ""So the Russian consulate will have to leave, and if these attacks continue, we’ll take further action.""
Russian officials have denied wrongdoing and condemned Poland's decision in statements to the press.

Pope Leo XIV wrapped up his first meeting with Vatican-accredited journalists Monday morning.
More than 1,000 members of the media were assembled to hear his remarks, according to the New York Times. Some of them even took their children.
The gathering took place in the Vatican’s Paul VI Hall, Vatican Media reported. There, the pontiff ""thanked reporters in Italian for their tireless work over these intense few weeks.""
""Let us disarm communication of all prejudice and resentment, fanaticism and even hatred,"" the pope told the crowd of reporters. ""Let us disarm words, and we will help disarm the world.""

""The church recognizes in these witnesses — I am thinking of those who report on war even at the cost of their lives — the courage of those who defend dignity, justice and the right of people to be informed, because only informed individuals can make free choices,"" he said.
The pontiff also told the journalists they must act responsibly in using artificial intelligence in their work, asking them to ""ensure that it can be used for the good of all, so that it can benefit all of humanity.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-tighten-immigration-rules-voter-frustration-high-immigration-numbers-failed-experiment","UK to tighten immigration rules over voter frustration with high immigration numbers: 'Failed experiment'","Fox News contributor Gary Kaltbaum discusses the U.S. and China trade talks in Switzerland and more on ‘Fox News Live.’
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce plans on Monday to tighten immigration rules amid pressure from voters upset over high levels of immigration.
Starmer, whose center-left Labour Party won a landslide victory in July, is under pressure as Member of Parliament Nigel Farage's right-wing and anti-immigration Reform UK party gains popularity.
Voters are becoming increasingly frustrated by high immigration numbers, which many argue have strained public services and intensified ethnic tensions in some parts of the country.
With Monday's legislation, Starmer is vowing to end what his office described as ""Britain’s failed experiment in open borders,"" less than two weeks after Reform UK took advantage of the immigration issue to secure victories in local elections.

Labour and the center-right Conservatives, which have long been the major parties in Britain, both suffered drops in support in the contests for local government councils and mayors.
Under the new plans, skilled visas will be restricted to people in graduate jobs, while visas for lower-skilled roles will only be issued in areas critical to the country's industrial strategy, and businesses must increase the training of British workers. Companies in the care sector will also no longer be able to apply for visas for workers recruited abroad.
""Every area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control,"" Starmer said in excerpts of a speech he plans to deliver on Monday. ""Enforcement will be tougher than ever and migration numbers will fall. We will create a system that is controlled, selective and fair.""
Migrants who are in the U.K. on visas are typically not eligible for welfare benefits and social housing.

The government also said it plans to raise English language requirements to include all adult dependents, who must show a basic understanding of English. The government said the goal behind the change is to help integration and cut the risks of exploitation.
""This is a clean break from the past and will ensure settlement in this country is a privilege that must be earned, not a right,"" Starmer said.
""And when people come to our country, they should also commit to integration and to learning our language,"" he added.
Employers' groups are concerned that tightening the rules on foreign workers will make it more difficult for companies to fill jobs.

The number of European Union migrants to Britain fell significantly after Brexit. But new visa rules, an increase in people arriving from Ukraine and Hong Kong as well as higher net numbers of foreign students have led to an overall surge in immigration in recent years.
""We inherited a failed immigration system where the previous government replaced free movement with a free market experiment,"" British interior minister Yvette Cooper said in a statement. ""We are taking decisive action to restore control and order to the immigration system.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/hamas-claims-release-american-hostage-edan-alexander","Hamas claims it will release American hostage Edan Alexander","Adi Alexander, father of Edan Alexander, an American hostage taken during the October 7th attack on the Gaza Strip, calls for Trump Administration to bring hostages home.
Hamas claimed on Sunday that it would release American hostage Edan Alexander.
Alexander, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, has been held captive in Gaza since the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel.
""As part of the efforts made by the brotherly mediators to achieve a ceasefire, Hamas has been in contact with the U.S. administration in recent days,"" a statement, translated into English from Arabic, from the terror organization said.
""The movement has shown a high level of positivity, and the Israeli soldier with dual American citizenship, [Edan] Alexander, will be released as part of the steps being taken toward a ceasefire, the opening of border crossings, and the entry of aid and relief for our people in the Gaza Strip,"" the statement continued.
PALESTINIAN LEADER DEMANDS HAMAS RELEASE REMAINING HOSTAGES

It's unclear when Alexander could be released.
Fox News learned that the United States had informed Israel of Hamas’s intention to release Alexander as ""a gesture to Americans, without compensation or conditions.""
The United States told Israel that this move is ""expected to lead to negotiations for the release of hostages,"" according to the original framework, laid out by Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, which Israel has already accepted.

Israel is preparing for the possibility that this move will be carried out.
Khalil al-Hayya, who is Hamas’ political chief in Gaza, echoed the statement, reiterating ""the movement has shown a high level of positivity"" when speaking about the effort to free Alexander.
GAZANS SPEAK OUT AGAINST HAMAS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 18 YEARS
""The Hamas movement affirms its readiness to immediately begin intensive negotiations and make serious efforts to reach a final agreement to end the war, exchange prisoners as mutually agreed upon, and manage the Gaza Strip by an independent, professional body, ensuring sustained calm and stability for many years, alongside reconstruction and ending the siege,"" al-Hayya shared in a statement.
Raised in Tenafly, New Jersey, Alexander moved to Israel at 18 to volunteer for military service in the IDF’s Golani Brigade. He lived with his grandparents in Tel Aviv and at Kibbutz Hazor, where he was part of a group of lone soldiers.
He was kidnapped on the morning of October 7 — a Saturday, he wasn’t required to remain on base. His mother was visiting from abroad, and like many lone soldiers, he had the option to go home for the weekend. But he chose to stay, not wanting to leave his comrades short-staffed on guard duty.
There are 59 hostages still in Gaza, at least 24 of whom are assessed to be alive, including Alexander, now 21 years old after having spent two birthdays in Hamas captivity.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters also released a statement following the announcement of Alexander's potential release, saying that they ""are embracing and supporting the Alexander family.""

""Should this release be confirmed, the release of Edan Alexander must mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement that will secure the freedom of all remaining hostages,"" the statement read.
""President Trump, you've given the families of all the hostages hope. Please, complete your mission and bring them all home.""
NEW PULITZER PRIZE WINNER DISPARAGED ISRAELIS KIDNAPPED BY HAMAS ON OCT 7, QUESTIONED THEIR 'HOSTAGE' STATUS
President Donald Trump recently marked his 100th day in office, and the families of the five Americans still held hostage urged him to reflect on his strategy and apply pressure on both Israel and Hamas, through both economic and diplomatic means, to secure the release of all hostages.
In addition, fifty members of Congress sent Trump a letter May 9 urging him to prioritize getting the remaining hostages out.
""As months have passed since the most recent exchange, we must keep the five remaining Americans and additional 54 hostages top of mind. The five American hostages include Edan Alexander, Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai. Only Alexander is believed to be alive while Nuetra, Chen, Haggai and Weinstein Haggai were either murdered on October 7th or in captivity,"" the group wrote in a letter to President Trump.
""Our government’s most solemn responsibility is to keep Americans safe. With that responsibility in mind, we urge you to use all diplomatic tools at your disposal, in concert with our regional allies and partners, to ensure Edan’s release and the release of the remains of the deceased American hostages as soon as possible. Every day in captivity adds to the nightmare for the hostages and their families. We must bring them home now,"" - 50 members of Congress

While there is evident frustration among the families of the hostages, who have made clear the Israeli government has not offered anywhere near the same level of support or communication provided by both the Biden and Trump administrations, they said that, ultimately, the adversary is the terrorist organization that captured, in some instances, and continues to hold captive their loved ones.
""Prime Minister Netanyahu must immediately fulfill the supreme moral obligation — and the demand of the vast majority of the Israeli public — to bring everyone back: the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial in our country,"" the organization said. ""No one should be left behind.""
Qatar and Egypt released a joint statement praising Hamas' claim that Alexander would be released.
The countries also said they ""reaffirm their continued joint efforts in mediating the situation in the Gaza strip.""

Five fishermen missing since mid-March were rescued at sea last week, surviving 55 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean by drinking rain and seawater, the Ecuadorian navy said.
The three Peruvian and two Colombian fishermen were found on May 7 by an Ecuadorian tuna boat called Aldo. The navy said the fishermen had reported damage to their boat’s alternator two days after setting sail from Pucusana Bay, south of Peru’s capital Lima.
Ecuadorian navy Frigate Capt. Maria Fares told The Associated Press that the equipment failure caused communication and navigation tools to malfunction.
""They had no starter, lights and everything that a battery generates,"" she said. To survive, they had to ""take rusted water out of the engine (and) when a fish passed by, they caught it and parboiled it to eat.""
Fares added that they also drank rain and seawater to survive.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed on Sunday to meet face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Turkey.
Putin initially proposed the Thursday meeting this weekend, and President Donald Trump prompted Zelenskyy to accept the offer. Putin said the talks in Istanbul must be held without preconditions and with the goal of lasting peace.
""We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy. There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses,"" Zelenskyy wrote.
Trump encouraged Zelenskyy to accept Putin's meeting earlier on Sunday. Ukraine and Russia are currently under a ceasefire marking the anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.

""President Putin of Russia doesn’t want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH,"" Trump wrote on social media. ""Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY. At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the U.S., will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!""
""I’m starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin, who’s too busy celebrating the Victory of World War ll, which could not have been won (not even close!) without the United States of America. HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!"" he added.

Putin has thus far offered few, if any, concessions but is now saying talks should address the root causes of the war. He said he would speak to Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan later on Sunday about facilitating the negotiations, which he said could result in a ceasefire.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-marine-corps-creates-attack-drone-team-arms-race-russia-china-heats-up","US Marine Corps creates attack drone team as arms race with Russia, China heats up","Fox News contributor and Army veteran Brett Velicovich shares insight into the United States' drone capabilities and how it compares to adversaries like Russia and China.
The U.S. Marine Corps established an attack drone team earlier this year to respond to the rapid development of armed first-person view (FPV) drone technology and tactics, offering a glimpse into the evolving landscape of modern warfare and how future battles could be fought.
The Marine Corps Attack Drone Team (MCADT) will be based at the Weapons Training Battalion, Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia.
The FPV drones used will offer squad-level lethality at a range of up to 20 kilometers, nearly 12.5 miles, for under $5,000, compared to more expensive weapons systems with less capability, according to a press release from the service.

""MCADT is committed to rapidly integrating armed first-person view drones into the FMF [Fleet Marine Force], enhancing small-unit lethality and providing organic capabilities that warfighters currently lack,"" said Maj. Alejandro Tavizon, the headquarters company commander at Weapons Training Battalion and officer in charge of MCADT.
""By leveraging emerging technologies and refining drone employment tactics, we are ensuring that Marines remain agile, adaptive, and lethal in the modern battlespace.""
Brett Velicovich, an Army veteran with extensive drone experience, told Fox News Digital that the creation of MCADT has been long overdue as the United States enters a drone arms race with adversaries like China, Russia and Iran.

""For a while now, we haven't had the needed technology, the needed expertise in low-cost, highly scalable, lethal drone technology that, frankly, is going to be the next part of every piece of the next war that we fight,"" he said.
Velicovich argued that the United States is far behind other countries, especially China, when it comes to the production of drone technology, and needs to start looking at drones not just as surveillance assets, but as a form of ammunition.
He pointed to Russia’s war in Ukraine and the large-scale advancements in domestic drone production that have allowed Ukrainian forces to strike multi-million-dollar enemy tanks and vehicles with drones that cost a few hundred dollars.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced in December that Ukraine manufactured over 1.5 million FPV drones in 2024, including reconnaissance, kamikaze and long-range deep-strike drones. Domestically produced drones accounted for 96.2% of all unmanned aerial vehicles used by Ukrainian forces during the year.
""You have companies and manufacturing plants in Ukraine building 100,000 drones per month. One manufacturing plant is building 100,000 of these things per month. That's real scale. That's where we need to be,"" Velicovich told Fox News Digital.
The WSJ, citing one Department of Defense estimate, reported that the U.S. has the capacity to build up to 100,000 drones a year.

US, EUROPEAN ALLIES DEMAND ACTION TO END RUSSIA'S USE OF IRANIAN DRONES IN UKRAINE
The number is far below what the United States’ adversaries, such as Russia and China, produce in a year, raising national security concerns.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking at a meeting of the Military-Industrial Commission in late April, said that almost all of the country’s defense enterprises had met their orders in full last year, highlighting Moscow’s efforts to ramp up its war machine.
""Over 1.5 million drones of various types were delivered, with about 4,000 so-called FPV drones equipped with virtual reality control systems supplied to the frontlines daily,"" Putin said, according to a transcript released by the Kremlin. ""I know well, just as many of you here do, that these weapons are still in short supply. We need more of them.""

Chinese technology company DJI is also making significant inroads in drone production, in both U.S. and Asian markets. It touts itself as the world's leading manufacturer of consumer and commercial drones.
Craig Singleton, a senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that the Shenzhen-based company dominates the global drone market, controlling more than 70% of the worldwide market share.
""That’s alarming, because DJI drones are essentially data collectors for Beijing — giving China potential access to sensitive infrastructure imagery, flight patterns, and more. It’s not just a market-share problem — it’s a national security threat,"" he said.

AI-POWERED ATTACK DRONES TAKE FLIGHT
Singleton added that the U.S. doesn’t need to match China drone for drone, but it needs a production floor that’s sustainable, somewhere around a minimum of 250,000 drones per year.
""We are absolutely in a drone arms race with China — and losing isn’t an option. Success will depend on scaling production, protecting sensitive supply chains, and turbocharging innovation,"" he said. ""It's not just about building drones — it’s about fielding smarter, cheaper and more resilient swarms faster than Beijing.""

Doyle taught at the Catholic research university for 40 years.

Pope Francis, the 266th Vicar of Christ, created Provest a cardinal in 2023.
""Pope Francis’ first major document was called ‘Evangelii gaudium,’ ‘The joy of the gospel,"" Doyle said.
In his evanescent address, Pope Leo XIV said, ""To all you brothers and sisters of Rome, Italy, of all the world, we want to be a synodal church, walking and always seeking peace, charity, closeness, especially to those who are suffering.""
""Pope Francis was really big into this idea of synodality,"" Doyle said.

""For him, in his very brief remarks, to say we must be a synodal church, that is a big signal that he intends to continue much of what Pope Francis was about,"" he said of Pope Leo XIV.
The first American pope, though pointing to Francis’ papacy symbolically, dressed in traditional garb including a red mozzetta and white cassock. Pope Francis, in 2013, was notably absent of adornments on the balcony for his first public appearance as elected pontiff.
""He's signaling he intends to be traditional in some ways,"" Doyle said. ""It'll be interesting to see if he lives in the Apostolic Palace.""
The papal apartments at the Apostolic Palace are the official residence of the pope. Pope Francis broke tradition and declined residency there and, instead, lived at Domus Sanctae Marthae, the location where cardinal electors stay during a conclave.

""In some ways, maybe he's going to be different from Francis,"" Doyle said. ""Francis did do some things that alienated traditionalists.""
Prevost was ordained on June 19, 1982. During his ministry, Cardinal Prevost was elected as head of the Augustinian Province of Chicago, his hometown, and served as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, among other notable titles.
The newest Bishop of Rome selected the papal name ""Leo"" and while it is presently unclear which of the 13 namesakes he admired most, Leo the Great, the first Pope Leo, and Pope Leo XIII seem ahead of the pack, according to Doyle.

Pope Leo XIII is often renowned for writing the first of the great Catholic social encyclicals, Rerum Novarum.
""In Latin, Rerum Novarum is an idiom, and it means ‘On Revolutionary Changes,’"" Doyle said. ""It's like an idiom for revolution. Although, a lot of people just translate it literalistically as ‘On New Things.’""
The encyclical, according to Doyle, addresses the rise of communism and the industrial revolution, including new and harsh conditions for workers in the 19th century.

""It starts out with a condemnation of socialism,"" Doyle said. ""Although, by socialism, he meant what we would only use the word ‘communism’ today.""
""He condemned it as being out of touch with the natural law. Because that natural law would tell us that ownership is something that is kind of natural to human beings; that we’re going to have property, if we make things and so on, that they are ours,"" Doyle added.

Doyle said that Catholic social teaching is general and addresses basic human principles about the economy and society with some room for interpretation.
""I think that he's going to be a very balanced pope,"" Doyle said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday proposed direct talks with Ukrainian officials to finally bring an end to the war that began with a 2022 invasion by Moscow.
Putin has thus far offered few, if any, concessions but is now proposing talks with Ukraine in the Turkish city of Istanbul that he says must be held without preconditions and with the goal of lasting peace.
""We are proposing that Kyiv resume direct negotiations without any preconditions,"" Putin said in a televised statement on Sunday. ""We offer the Kyiv authorities to resume negotiations already on Thursday, in Istanbul.""
The Kremlin chief said talks should address the root causes of the war and that he would speak to Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan later on Sunday about facilitating the negotiations, which he said could result in a ceasefire.

""Our proposal, as they say, is on the table,"" Putin said. ""The decision is now up to the Ukrainian authorities and their curators, who are guided, it seems, by their personal political ambitions, and not by the interests of their peoples.""
The proposal was a welcome sign to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said Kyiv was willing to negotiate but that Moscow must agree to a ceasefire.
""It is a positive sign that the Russians have finally begun to consider ending the war,"" he wrote on X. ""The entire world has been waiting for this for a very long time. And the very first step in truly ending any war is a ceasefire. There is no point in continuing the killing even for a single day. We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire – full, lasting, and reliable – starting tomorrow, May 12th, and Ukraine is ready to meet.""
U.S. President Donald Trump said hundreds of thousands of lives will be saved if the ""bloodbath"" of the war could end.
""A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending 'bloodbath' hopefully comes to an end. It will be a whole new, and much better, WORLD. I will continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens. The USA wants to focus, instead, on Rebuilding and Trade. A BIG week upcoming!""
Putin's proposal for direct talks came hours after European leaders demanded on Saturday in Kyiv that the Russian president agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face new sanctions. But Putin dismissed attempts by some European powers to issue what he described as ""ultimatums.""
The Russian leader said he does not rule out that Moscow and Kyiv will agree on ""some new truces, a new ceasefire"" during negotiations in Turkey, saying that the talks would be the first step towards a ""sustainable"" peace.
Russian President Vladimir Putin gives a statement to the media at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, May 11, 2025. (Reuters)
Russia had proposed several ceasefires, including a moratorium on striking energy facilities, an Easter ceasefire and most recently the 72-hour truce during the celebrations marking 80 years since victory in World War Two, Putin said.
Putin said that during the ceasefire in May, Ukraine attacked Russia with 524 aerial drones, 45 sea drones, and several Western missiles. But Ukraine accused Russia of violating the temporary truces, including the May 8-10 ceasefire.
Despite Putin's offer of peace talks, Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine on Sunday, injuring one person and damaging several private homes, Ukrainian officials said.
Putin has maintained his conditions for ending the war despite pressure from Trump and warnings from European leaders.
In June, he said Ukraine must officially drop its hopes of joining NATO and pull its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed by Russia. Moscow has also urged the U.S. to recognize Russia's control over parts of Ukraine.
But Russian officials have said they are not against Kyiv's ambitions to join the European Union.

Putin mentioned the 2022 draft deal Russia and Ukraine negotiated shortly after the Russian invasion started.
Under that draft, Ukraine should agree to permanent neutrality in exchange for international security guarantees from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S.
""It was not Russia that broke off negotiations in 2022. It was Kyiv,"" Putin said. ""Russia is ready to negotiate without any preconditions.""
Putin thanked China, Brazil, African and Middle Eastern countries and the U.S. for their efforts to mediate.

President Donald Trump on Saturday promised to increase trade with India and Pakistan after the two nations agreed to a ceasefire to end the conflict with each other.
""While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great Nations,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""Additionally, I will work with you both to see if, after a 'thousand years,' a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir. God Bless the leadership of India and Pakistan on a job well done!!!""
The fragile ceasefire was holding on Sunday after several days of intense fighting, with dozens killed as missiles and drones were fired at each other's military bases. The deal was reached after diplomacy and pressure from the U.S., but artillery fire was witnessed in Indian Kashmir within hours of the agreement.
Attacks were witnessed in cities near the border under a blackout, as was the case in the previous two evenings.

The fighting began on Wednesday after 26 men were killed two weeks prior in an attack targeting Hindus in Pahalgam in Kashmir. Both countries rule part of Kashmir but claim full control.
Late on Saturday, India accused Pakistan of violating the agreement to stop firing and that the Indian armed forces had been told to ""deal strongly"" with any continued firings.
Pakistan blamed India for violating the truce and said it was committed to the ceasefire.

The fighting and explosions reported overnight had quieted on both sides of the border by dawn on Sunday.
""I am very proud of the strong and unwaveringly powerful leadership of India and Pakistan for having the strength, wisdom, and fortitude to fully know and understand that it was time to stop the current aggression that could have lead to to [sic] the death and destruction of so many, and so much,"" Trump said in his post.
""Millions of good and innocent people could have died! Your legacy is greatly enhanced by your brave actions. I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,"" he added.

He credits his Papal name choice as a response to the digital age facing the Catholic Church. (Credit: AP via Vatican Media)
In his first official remarks as pope, Leo XIV delivered a powerful message to the College of Cardinals on Saturday, warning that artificial intelligence (AI) presents serious new risks to human dignity. He called on the Catholic Church to step up and respond to these challenges with moral clarity and bold action.
Speaking at the New Synod Hall, the Pope said the Catholic Church has faced similar moments before.
He compared today’s rapid AI technological change to the upheaval of the 19th century industrial revolution, saying the Church must again defend workers and promote justice.
""Pope Leo XIII, with the historic Encyclical Rerum Novarum, addressed the social question in the context of the first great industrial revolution,"" Pope Leo XIV said. ""Today, the Church offers to all her treasure of social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and the developments of artificial intelligence.""

Pope Leo XIV, formerly Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, is the first American to be elected pope.
A former missionary and head of the Dicastery for Bishops, he speaks English, Spanish and Italian and was widely seen as a unifying choice after the death of Pope Francis. His decision to take the name ""Leo"" connects his mission with Pope Leo XIII’s focus on social justice.
Under Pope Francis, the Vatican greatly expanded its digital outreach. It restructured its media operations, launched popular social media efforts and introduced ethical guidelines for AI. The ""Rome Call for AI Ethics"" is a joint initiative between the Church and tech leaders promoting transparency in AI development.
Pope Leo XIV made clear that he would continue this work. In his speech, he described AI as a powerful force that could reshape labor, society and even how we see ourselves. He emphasized that people, not profit, must remain at the center.

""These are Gospel principles through which the merciful face of the Father has been revealed and continues to be revealed in the Son made man,"" he said. ""Let us take up this precious legacy and continue on the journey, inspired by the same hope that is born of faith.""
He also urged Catholics to stay grounded in quiet prayer and discernment in a noisy digital world. He quoted Scripture to say that God is often heard not in thunder or spectacle, but in ""the whisper of a gentle breeze"" or ""the sound of sheer silence.""
The Pope also reflected on the recent death of Pope Francis. He called the moment both sorrowful and filled with God’s grace. He described the transition to a new pope as a ""paschal event,"" a kind of spiritual turning point, and thanked his predecessor for his life of service.

Former campaign advisors of President Donald Trump are at work on a new campaign in the Balkans, hoping to tip the scales for the right-wing Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, who faces off against the highly favored Socialist Party leader and Prime Minister Edi Rama in Sunday’s parliamentary elections.
Former Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita, Trump 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort, and strategist and pollster Tony Fabrizio round out the team backing Berisha, according to the Associated Press. LaCivita has compared Trump and Berisha, saying they are both ""unfairly prosecuted and persecuted by a government that has no regard for Democracy.""
When asked by Syri TV’s Cim Peka why the Albanian election is important for the world, LaCivita said that ""one of the things that many of us know in the United States is that the Soros family is very active in politics around the globe, and it’s not just regular politics, it’s destabilizing politics."" LaCivita said that the family thrives ""in an environment where the governments are insecure and they found the perfect home unfortunately in Albania, and they found the perfect prime minister in Edi Rama.""

The Socialist Rama is hoping to win a fourth consecutive term as PM in Sunday's election on a promise of bringing Albania into the European Union while the country still faces major problems of graft and corruption.
LaCivita explained that calling out Soros’ involvement was important ""because it has an impact on Albania’s future."" He said that Berisha’s campaign is ""about the Albanian people,"" explaining that their ""biggest desire is to be able to work, live, and raise a family and have a future and so any time that there are individuals or that there are organizations that want to create an atmosphere that make that difficult, to me they’re the actual enemy and those are the people that we wage campaigns to actually defeat.""
George and Alex Soros’ Open Society Foundations has been very involved in the Balkans and has invested over $131 million in Albania in a period of 18 years.
Requests sent to representatives of the Soros' Open Society were not returned by press time.
When Fox News Digital spoke to Berisha in April about the impediments he faced in the May 11 elections, he named the sanctions placed against him by the Biden administration for allegations of corruption in 2021. ""I’m not able to meet with Albanian Americans, which are so numerous, and in this election, for the first time, they have the right to vote for the party and candidate they prefer in their country of origin,"" Berisha explained.

To date, there appears to be no movement on sanctions against Berisha. In April, the State Department did not respond to Fox News Digital’s questions about whether it would consider lifting sanctions against Berisha, and whether the sanctions in place impeded free and fair elections in Albania. A spokesperson told Fox News Digital Thursday that ""the Department has nothing to report on this designation at this time.""
Berisha’s race has been fraught by other complications, including being stripped of his legal immunity in December 2023 and held under house arrest until November 2024. Berisha is currently awaiting trial on corruption charges.
Berisha told Fox News Digital that the charges were the product of lawfare leveled against him by Rama and Soros.
Berisha is not the only opposition candidate who has faced charges in the lead-up to elections. Former Albanian president Ilir Meta was also arrested on corruption allegations in October 2024.

Former Albanian Ambassador to the United States and the United Nations Agim Nesho told Fox News Digital that ""May 11 elections are unfolding under intense pressure from the ruling Socialist Party, which has clung to power for over 12 years. The regime stands accused of jailing opposition leaders on fabricated charges, weaponizing state institutions, and silencing dissent in a country where citizens are increasingly afraid to speak freely.""
Nesho claimed that ""the Albanian people are being denied the basic democratic rights to organize, vote, and oppose the government without fear. This system of repression, critics say, is supported—either tacitly or directly—by elements of the Biden administration and global actors like Alex Soros, who have worked to undercut the opposition and prevent free and fair elections, much like the political persecution seen in the United States against former President Donald Trump.""
Saying that the ""election could mark a turning point,"" as ""a true grassroots movement is rising—ready to challenge state corruption and restore Albania’s path to freedom, development, and democratic self-determination,"" Nesho called ""on the Trump administration to closely monitor these elections and send a clear message to Tirana: America is watching.""

Nesho said ""the United States must stand firmly on the side of democracy and the rule of law. The Albanian people deserve free elections, not another manipulated outcome enforced through fear and political imprisonment.""
Politico reported that while Rama’s Socialist Party appears to be ahead in polling, the impact Albanians who live abroad being allowed to vote for the first time, and a lack of reliability in polling data may still leave room for Berisha to secure victory and return to office as prime minister.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-its-allies-push-30-day-ceasefire-starting-monday","Ukraine and its allies push for a 30-day ceasefire starting Monday","Vice President JD Vance describes the Trump administrations Russia-Ukraine war strategy and addresses the economic impact of tariffs on The Story.
In a show of unity in Kyiv on Saturday, leaders from four major European countries threatened to ratchet up pressure if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.
The leaders, from France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland, said the proposal to start the ceasefire on Monday was supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, whom they had briefed over the phone earlier in the day. Their statement came amid mounting efforts to persuade Moscow to agree to a truce that would allow for peace talks on ending over three years of full-scale war.
ON THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF UKRAINE INVASION, EUROPEAN LEADERS SHOW SUPPORT, EXPRESS UNEASE
The demand was announced in a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and countries leading the so-called ""coalition of the willing"": a group of over 30 countries who have pledged to strengthen Ukraine to deter Russian aggression. They included French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who on Saturday traveled to Ukraine together for the first time.
The ceasefire would include a halt to fighting on land, sea and in the air. The leaders threatened to ratchet up sanctions, including on Russia’s energy and banking sectors, if Putin did not comply.

Earlier that day, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Kyiv and its allies are ready for a ""full, unconditional ceasefire"" with Russia for ""at least 30 days"" starting Monday. He added the four visiting leaders and Zelenskyy had had a ""constructive"" phone call with Trump.
Saturday marked the last day of a unilateral three-day ceasefire declared by Russia that Ukraine says the Kremlin’s forces have repeatedly violated.
In March, the United States proposed an immediate, limited 30-day truce, which Ukraine accepted, but the Kremlin has held out for terms more to its liking.
Building up Ukraine’s military capabilities will be a key deterrent against Russia, the European leaders said Saturday. This will require supplying Ukraine with robust quantities of arms to deter future attacks and investing in its defense sector. A force comprised of foreign troops could also be deployed as an added ""reassurance"" measure, Macron said.
RUSSIA DECLARES 3-DAY CEASEFIRE IN UKRAINE FOR WWII VICTORY DAY
The French president added that the United States will take the lead in monitoring a proposed ceasefire, with support from European countries, and threatened ""massive sanctions ... prepared and coordinated between Europeans and Americans,"" should Russia violate the truce.
But he said details about potential European deployments to Ukraine were still being fine-tuned. No mention was made of NATO membership, still Kyiv’s top choice for a security guarantee.
The priority is to make the war too costly for Russia to keep fighting, Ukraine's Sybiha told reporters on the sidelines of the event.
Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said Saturday that a ""comprehensive"" 30-day ceasefire, covering attacks from the air, land, sea and on infrastructure, ""will start the process for ending the largest and longest war in Europe since World War II.""

Earlier on Saturday, the European leaders joined a ceremony at Kyiv's Independence Square marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. They lit candles alongside Zelenskyy at a makeshift flag memorial for fallen Ukrainian soldiers and civilians slain since Russia's invasion.
Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to an agreement to end the war, but while Zelenskyy agreed to the American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, Russia has not signed on. Instead, it has kept up attacks along the roughly 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer) front line, including deadly strikes on residential areas with no obvious military targets.
On Saturday morning, local officials in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region said Russian shelling over the past day killed three residents and wounded four more. Another civilian man died on the spot on Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin.
Speaking to reporters in Kyiv, French President Emmanuel Macron said: ""What’s happening with Poland, Germany and Great Britain is a historic moment for European defense and toward a greater independence for our security. Obviously, for Ukraine and all of us. It’s a new era. It’s a Europe that sees itself as a power.""
PUTIN ORDERS PARTIAL CEASEFIRE AFTER CALL WITH TRUMP BUT NOT THE ONE HOPED FOR
Trump said last week that he doubts Putin wants to end his war in Ukraine, expressing new skepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon, and hinted at further sanctions against Russia.

Progress on ending the war has seemed elusive in the months since Trump returned to the White House, and his previous claims of imminent breakthroughs have failed to come to fruition. Trump has previously pushed Ukraine to cede territory to Russia to end the war, threatening to walk away if a deal becomes too difficult.
Ukraine’s European allies view its fate as fundamental to the continent’s security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily, regardless of whether Trump pulls out.

Vance suggested the U.S. will not intervene in the conflict between India and Pakistan, arguing the dust-up is ""fundamentally none of our business.""
U.S. President Donald Trump announced in a Truth Social post that India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire.
""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" the president declared in his Saturday morning post.
Both foreign nations are among the handful of world powers that possess nuclear weapons, making tensions between the two countries particularly dangerous on the global stage.

Pakistan’s foreign minister said Saturday his country would consider de-escalation if India stopped its attacks, after India said it sought non-escalation if Pakistan agreed to do the same.
Both countries traded strikes Saturday during the conflict sparked by a massacre last month, which India attributes to Pakistan.
Ishaq Dar, Pakistan's foreign minister, warned that ""our response will follow"" if India launched any strikes.
Dar told Pakistan’s Geo News that he also delivered his message to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who contacted him after the top U.S. diplomat spoke to India's officials.

""We responded because our patience had reached its limit. If they stop here, we will also consider stopping,"" Dar said.
Rubio spoke to his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, stressing that ""both sides need to identify methods to de-escalate and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation,"" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Saturday, adding that the secretary offered U.S. support to facilitate ""productive discussion.""
India said it targeted Pakistan's air bases after Islamabad fired several missiles at military and civilian infrastructure in India's Punjab state early Saturday.
Pakistan earlier said it had intercepted most missiles and that it was carrying out retaliatory strikes.

Indian Col. Sofiya Qureshi said at a news conference in New Delhi that Pakistan had targeted health facilities and schools at three air bases in Indian-controlled Kashmir.
""Befitting reply has been given to Pakistani actions,"" she said.
Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said India was committed to ""non-escalation"" if Pakistan reciprocated. But, she said, Pakistani ground forces were seen moving toward forward areas, ""indicating an offensive intent to further escalate the situation.""
""Indian armed forces remain in a high state of operational readiness,"" she said.

Singh said India's forces carried out ""precision strikes only at identified military targets in response to Pakistani actions,"" which included technical infrastructure, command and control centers, radar locations and weapon storage areas to ensure ""minimum collateral damage.""
""All hostile actions have been effectively countered and responded to appropriately,"" Singh said.
The Pakistani military said it used medium-range Fateh missiles to target an Indian missile storage facility and airbases in the Indian cities of Pathankot and Udhampur.
Pakistan Army spokesman, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, said the country's air force assets were safe after India's strikes.

(Credit: Denmark Foreign Ministry)
Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Friday that ""you cannot spy against an ally"" in response to reports that the U.S. was gathering intelligence on Greenland, as U.S. President Donald Trump has continued to suggest purchasing the Arctic island.
""Cooperation about defense and deterrence and security in the northern part of Europe is getting more and more important,"" Frederiksen told The Associated Press. ""Of course, you cannot spy against an ally.""
Frederiksen made the comments as Denmark and Greenland push back on Trump's desire to acquire the autonomous Danish territory, stressing that it is not for sale. Trump, however, has not ruled out taking it by military force despite Denmark being a NATO ally.

""I don’t rule it out. I don’t say I’m going to do it, but I don’t rule out anything,"" Trump said earlier this week during an interview on NBC News' ""Meet the Press.""
""We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of and we’ll cherish them and all of that, but we need that for international security,"" he added.
The Danish prime minister's statement on Friday came the day after Denmark summoned the top American diplomat in the country for an explanation to a report from The Wall Street Journal about several high-ranking officials under the U.S. director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, directing intelligence agency heads to collect information on Greenland’s independence movement and views about U.S. resource extraction on the island.

Acting head of the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen, Jennifer Hall Godfrey, met with Danish diplomat Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen at the Danish Foreign Ministry, although details of the meeting were not disclosed.
Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told Greenland newspaper Sermitsiaq that the reports of U.S. espionage are unacceptable and disrespectful.
Nielsen said last month that Greenland ""will never, ever be a piece of property that can be bought by just anyone"" and that ""the talks from the United States have not been respectful.""

Gabbard’s office released a statement saying she had made three ""criminal"" referrals to the U.S. Justice Department over intelligence community leaks in response to the report from The Wall Street Journal, which cited two sources familiar with the matter.
""The Wall Street Journal should be ashamed of aiding deep state actors who seek to undermine the President by politicizing and leaking classified information,"" Gabbard said. ""They are breaking the law and undermining our nation’s security and democracy. Those who leak classified information will be found and held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.""

Pakistan's armed forces said they hit back at India, targeting military sites, after India fired missiles at three of its air bases in a frightening escalation between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.
India had earlier targeted the three air bases inside Pakistan with missiles, most of which were intercepted, on Saturday, Pakistani military officials said.
The strike marks the latest escalation between the nuclear-armed rivals, a move triggered by a mass shooting that India blames Pakistan for.

Two men were found guilty on Friday of cutting down Britain's 'Sycamore Gap' tree two years ago, felling the much-loved landmark whose dramatic silhouette had featured in a Hollywood movie in what prosecutors described as a ""moronic mission"".
The sycamore, estimated to be almost 200 years old, stood at the centre of a dramatic dip in the landscape alongside the historic Hadrian's Wall in northern England, making it a popular spot for photographers, hikers and even marriage proposals.
2 MEN CHARGED WITH FELLING 150-YEAR-OLD ‘ROBIN HOOD’ TREE IN ENGLAND
Such was its fame that it featured in the 1991 film ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" and its felling in September 2023 provoked widespread grief and anger.
Prosecutor Richard Wright told jurors at Newcastle Crown Court last month that Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, were responsible for the ""mindless vandalism"", expertly and deliberately cutting it down with a chainsaw.
The felling also caused damage to part of Hadrian's Wall, built by the Romans almost 2,000 years ago and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Graham and Carruthers, who travelled to the site in the Northumberland National Park from their homes in the Carlisle area, about 25 miles away, had denied any involvement. But they were convicted of two counts of criminal damage.
The men will be sentenced on July 15.
""For over a century, Sycamore Gap has been an iconic natural landmark in the north east of England, bringing immeasurable joy to those visiting the area,"" Chief Crown Prosecutor Gale Gilchrist said.
""In just under three minutes, Graham and Carruthers ended its historic legacy in a deliberate and mindless act of destruction.""
During the trial, the jury was shown a video of their ""moronic mission"", filmed on Graham's mobile phone, which showed grainy footage of what appeared to be the iconic tree being cut down.

The prosecution said the men had taken a wedge of the tree as a trophy and messages they sent to each other afterwards showed they had been ""revelling"" in the worldwide reaction to the incident. No explanation has been given for their actions.
The National Trust, a heritage conservation charity which looks after the site, said last August there were signs of life at the base of the tree, giving hope it might live on.

Kashmir standoff raises specter of US-China proxy fight","Fox News State Department correspondent Gillian Turner speaks with Indian Ambassador to the U.S. Vinay Kwatra and Pakistani Ambassador to the U.S. Rizwan Sheikh about growing tensions between the two nations on 'Special Report.'
The hostilities between India and Pakistan over the contested territory of Kashmir are igniting fears that a localized skirmish could boil over into a wider conflict and threaten the stability of the region.
Watching closely is China and President Xi Jinping, a party to the Kashmir dispute with a stake in the outcome.
""For China, the stakes are high. Pakistan is its closest ally, and Beijing would not like to see it humiliated,"" Sadanand Dhume, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), told Fox News Digital.
""Seen through the prism of U.S.-China competition, each country has a 'side' in this conflict. China is joined at the hip with Pakistan, whereas the U.S. and India have grown increasingly close over the past two decades,"" Dhume added.
PAKISTAN FEARS INDIA INCURSION 'IMMINENT' AMID HEIGHTENED TENSIONS FOLLOWING TERROR ATTAC

The U.S. war in Afghanistan after 9/11 created a dependence on Pakistan’s military and intelligence that required close cooperation. Since the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, U.S. engagement with Pakistan has been limited and Islamabad has less relevance for Washington’s foreign policy aims.
Max Abrahms, an expert on terrorism at Northeastern University, told Fox News Digital that the fight over Kashmir could now become a venue for U.S.-China competition.
""The India-Pakistan conflict may emerge as a proxy war where India is backed by the U.S. and Pakistan is backed by China,"" Abrahms said.
Yigal Carmon, president of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) and a former counterterrorism advisor to the Israeli government, told Fox News Digital that Kashmir is not just a clash between India and Pakistan. If the war escalates, he said, it could lead to the dismantling of Pakistan and have repercussions in Afghanistan, Iran and China.

""Balochistan may soon acquire a de-facto independence. China will be one of the main losers of such a development, as it has heavily invested in the Gwadar Port, located in the Balochistan province of Pakistan,"" Carmon said.
New Delhi launched retaliatory strikes against Punjab and Pakistan-administered Kashmir following a deadly attack on tourists in the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region on April 22 that saw 26 people killed by terrorists.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged a forceful response, saying the perpetrators will be pursued till the ""ends of the earth.""

How far Pakistan will target India is uncertain, but Pakistan’s military, which yields significant influence in Pakistani politics, will likely want to exert a powerful response and avoid any appearances that the country looks weak.
""If Pakistan suffers a humiliating defeat, it would weaken the military’s grip on the country,"" AEI’s Dhume said.
Dhume also said that any conflict that unravels Pakistan’s domestic stability would give a boost to separatist groups in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces who have long sought independence from Pakistan.
PAKISTAN CALLS INDIA'S STRIKES AN ‘ACT OF WAR’ AND CLAIMS IT SHOT DOWN INDIAN FIGHTER JETS
Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, said that India will try to ensure that the conflict remains limited and focus its efforts on targeting terrorists, avoiding civilian casualties.
Bajpaee told Fox News Digital that maintaining an anti-Indian stance is important to the legitimacy of the Pakistani military and intelligence establishment, and adopting an assertive military posture will be necessary to assuage domestic pressures.

""Although I don’t see an imminent possibility of Pakistan breaking up or a spillover of the conflict into Iran or Afghanistan, the conflict could fundamentally alter the relationship between the military and the civilian government and population, which has already been in decline,"" Bajpaee said.
The fear for many experts and policymakers is whether the clashes lead to inadvertent escalation between two nuclear-armed powers. India and Pakistan have an estimated combined 342 nuclear warheads, according to the Arms Control Association, and their nuclear doctrines are motivated by their mutual enmity and desire to deter the other.

(Associated Press)
A 2018 deal between the Vatican and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) secured by Cardinal Pietro Parolin is once again under scrutiny as questions remain over how newly appointed Pope Leo XIV will take on the CCP.
The Parolin-brokered deal was and remains a controversial agreement between the leaders of the Catholic Church and the CCP, which has long oppressed Catholics across China.
While the agreement was championed by the late Pope Francis and his secretary of state, Parolin — the Vatican’s top diplomat — as a step toward ""normalizing"" Catholicism in the communist nation, experts argue it has brought dangerous consequences for the faithful.

""It erodes papal authority to appoint bishops, the leadership of the Catholic Church in China,"" Nina Shea, senior fellow and director of the Center for Religious Freedom at Hudson Institute, told Fox News Digital.
""A principal responsibility of a bishop is to train and ordain priests,"" she explained. ""Therefore, the CCP has been given control in determining the chain of authority in the hierarchical church.""
Under this agreement, all Catholic clergy are required to register with the CCP’s Patriotic Association — which was created in 1957 and was long rejected by the Catholic Church as illegitimate because it required that all clergy reject foreign influence, including that of the pope.
Parolin in 2019 said the aim of this agreement was ""to advance religious freedom in the sense of finding normalization for the Catholic community.""
Details of the deal remain unclear because it has been kept secret, explained Shea.
While the agreement reportedly looked to end the decades-long negative ties between the Vatican and the CCP by allowing China to have more influence over bishop appointments, experts have argued for years it gave too much authority to the oppressive government.
But there is an even greater problem when it comes to the Vatican seeming to have capitulated to the CCP.

Following the agreement, the Vatican additionally agreed to drop its support for the underground Catholic network, which has existed in China for decades and has supported millions of Catholics in the country.
According to Shea, the CCP essentially ""tricked"" the Vatican because it simultaneously, in what she believes was an unbeknownst move to Parolin, banned children from being allowed in the Catholic Church — this ban included important sacraments of the church like baptisms, holy communion and confirmations.
The ban effectively blocks the continuation of the Catholic Church in China.
""The underground, even during the harshest period under Mao, carried out this education and evangelization,"" Shea said. ""Without being able to perpetuate itself, the Catholic Church in China could die out in a couple generations.""
""It’s a campaign to create an atheist society,"" she added.
The Vatican did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s questions over whether Pope Leo will adhere to the agreement with the CCP or look to forge a new one.

TAIWAN EYES VATICAN-CHINA TIES AFTER POPE FRANCIS' DEATH
But in his first homily on Friday since being made leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Leo highlighted the church’s fight against rising atheism.
""There are many settings in which Jesus, although appreciated as a man, is reduced to a kind of charismatic leader or superman. This is true not only among non-believers but also among many baptized Christians, who thus end up living, at this level, in a state of practical atheism,"" he said. ""These are contexts where it is not easy to preach the Gospel and bear witness to its truth, where believers are mocked, opposed, despised or at best tolerated and pitied.""
The pope said, for this reason, ""missionary outreach is desperately needed.""
Pope Leo warned that a ""lack of faith"" has led to not only a ""loss of meaning in life"" for many, but also ""the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society.""

While congratulatory messages were issued by leaders of Catholic and non-Catholic nations alike, China did not issue a similar message upon the pope’s appointment on Thursday.
In a Friday press conference, when asked about the Church’s new leader, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, ""We hope that under the leadership of the new pope, the Vatican will continue to have dialogue with China in a constructive spirit, have in-depth communication on international issues of mutual interest, jointly advance the continuous improvement of the China-Vatican relations and make contributions to world peace, stability, development and prosperity.""

Pope Leo XIV, the first American pontiff to take up the highest seat in the Catholic Church, returned to the Sistine Chapel on Friday to deliver his first mass in an address to the more than 1.4 billion Catholics he now leads.
The pontiff urged outreach and missionary work and warned that much of what the Church stands for, and the belief in Jesus Christ, has been lessened in the eyes of both believers and non-believers.
""Today, too, there are many settings in which Jesus, although appreciated as a man, is reduced to a kind of charismatic leader or superman,"" he said in a homily translated from Italian, warning that this has led to even baptized Christians living in ""a state of practical atheism.""

""There are many settings in which the Christian faith is considered absurd, meant for the weak and unintelligent. Settings where other securities are preferred, like technology, money, success, power, or pleasure,"" the pope said.
The new pontiff will face many challenges ahead as followers wait to see how he will lead the church and which issues he will choose to put great emphasis on.
The pope has not said why he chose the name Leo to call himself, but papal names signify predecessors or values they admire, suggesting the newest pontiff will put great emphasis on social issues based on others in the papacy who have held that name.

Like his predecessor, Pope Francis, Leo is expected to focus on humanity and kindness, particularly in the face of global migration and helping the poor.
It remains unclear how this American pope will interact with the Trump administration, given apparent divisions over positions on the treatment of migrants and other issues involving human rights.

""These are contexts where it is not easy to preach the Gospel and bear witness to its truth, where believers are mocked, opposed, despised or at best tolerated and pitied,"" he said.
Pope Leo went on to say that ""A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/pope-leo-xiv-villanova-grad-introduces-himself-adorned-symbolism-proverbial-religious-devotion","Pope Leo XIV, Villanova grad, introduces himself adorned in symbolism, proverbial religious devotion","Cardinal Robert Prevost has been elected as the new pope of the Catholic Church, taking the name Leo XIV. He made his first public appearance at the Vatican to greet the faithful and deliver his inaugural prayer.
As silence and stillness calmed the eager world, Cardinal Protodeacon Dominique Mamberti, overlooking a sea of tens of thousands of teary-eyed viewers in St. Peter’s Square, introduced Catholics and non-faithful to the newest pontiff.
American Pope Leo XIV, born Robert Francis Prevost, was elected to take the papal seat and succeed the deceased Pope Francis on May 8, 2025, after four rounds of conclave voting by 133 members of the College of Cardinals.
As the world explores both the tender and commanding qualities that make Pope Leo XIV papabile and worthy of the Vicar of Christ title, one place, a small place of around 10,000 people, is beaming with pride for the newly elected Chicago-native.

""It's a super-happy day for all Catholics to have a new pope,"" Patrick Brennan, chair of Catholic Legal Studies at Villanova University, told Fox News Digital.
""I was sitting in the studio when I discovered, as everyone else did, that it was a Villanova graduate who was now the pope.""
Pope Leo XIV is a graduate of the Class of 1977.
Villanova University, a private Catholic university 12 miles outside of Philadelphia, enrolls just 6,700 undergraduate students and 3,100 graduate and law students, according to its website.
""It’s a hometown boy not just makes good but breaks all the molds,"" Brennan said. ""We have an American pope.""

Pope Leo XIV is the first pope to ever be elected from the United States.
Despite skepticism that the Sacred College would vote for an American pope, Brennan says he was ""thrilled"" to hear the announcement of Prevost.
""The people that I know who know him think that he's a wonderful priest,"" Brennan told Fox News Digital. ""He's been a wonderful member of the Augustinian order, and we know that Pope Francis has entrusted him with great responsibilities. It’s a happy day.""

Prevost was created a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2023.
The Augustinian religious order, formerly known as the Order of Saint Augustine and deeply rooted in the beliefs and teachings of influential theologian Saint Augustine, bishop of Hippo, was established in the 13th century.

""The Augustinians are not as well-known in the United States as the Jesuits are an important part of the life of the American church,"" Brennan said.
Pope Francis, a Jesuit and the first to serve as a pontificate, made history as the first member of a religious order in centuries.
Pope Leo XIV has followed suit historically.
""Though they don't have the presence that the Jesuits do, they do an amazing job,"" Brennan said of the Augustinians. ""This will give a huge vote of confidence for them about the work they're doing in the Church.""
In 1842, the Augustinians founded Villanova University in downtown Philadelphia until later relocating to suburban Philly, where the college is surrounded by lush greenery and beautiful architecture.

""When [Pope Leo XIV] would have been in Villanova in the 1970s, it was a beautiful suburban campus of a small Catholic liberal arts college with high standards and a great love of the Catholic tradition and a whole lot of Villanova spirit,"" Brennan said. ""When I came to Villanova, I was stunned, and I still am by the incredible enthusiasm Villanova students and alumni have for their experience and for the Villanova community.""
Pope Leo XIV celebrated his electoral triumph by praying the prayer of the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with the world.
""I think that that was one of the ways he symbolized his traditional piety,"" Brennan said.

""His desire to signal to the world that he's a Catholic who prays the way that Catholics traditionally do. Pope Francis was known for his great devotion to the blessed Virgin Mary, which is part of the reason he made the unusual decision to be buried in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore.""
Pope Francis, shortly after becoming the Bishop of Rome in 2013, revealed his burial plans.
""Choosing to pray the Hail Mary was a signal of continuity and piety,"" Brennan said of Pope Leo XIV.
Finally, for the namesake, Brennan says he envisions the selection was made as a symbolic gesture.

""He jumped over a whole century, back to the name of a pope who died in 1903 who left the Church a huge legacy of deep understanding of the place of a human person and the Catholic Church in the modern world,"" Brennan said.
""I think Pope Leo XIV, by choosing that name, is attaching himself to a legacy that he can, and I believe intends to, open for a world that's changed a great deal and needs new light and understanding of the kind he probably associates and finds in the world of Pope Leo XIII,"" Brennan said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping was photographed standing next to Vladimir Putin on Friday as thousands of Russian troops and military vehicles rumbled through Moscow’s Red Square during the country’s annual Victory Day parade.
The event, marking Russia’s 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, featured over 11,500 troops and more than 180 military vehicles, including tanks, armored infantry vehicles and artillery used on the battlefield in Ukraine. Drones that Russia has deployed in the war were also on display, according to Reuters.
""We are proud of their courage and determination, their spiritual force that always has brought us victory,"" Putin said about the Russian troops fighting in the war.
Russian flag carrier Aeroflot canceled more than 100 flights to and from Moscow and delayed over 140 others on Wednesday as the military were repelling repeated Ukrainian drone attacks on the capital.

Ukrainian authorities also reported scores of Russian strikes on Friday that killed at least two people in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and damaged buildings.
The strikes in Ukraine came despite Putin declaring a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine last month ahead of the Victory Day celebrations.
""All military actions are suspended for this period,"" the Kremlin said in a statement at the time, noting that the ceasefire would run through the end of Saturday, May 10. ""Russia believes that the Ukrainian side should follow this example.""
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he spoke with President Donald Trump on Thursday, who ""confirmed that he wants this war to end, is ready to help, and supports the need for a ceasefire.""
Zelenskyy said he informed Trump that ""Ukraine is ready for a 30-day ceasefire, starting even today. We are waiting for Russia to support this proposal. I also reaffirmed that Ukraine is ready to engage in talks in any format. But for that, Russia must demonstrate the seriousness of its intentions to end the war, starting with a full unconditional ceasefire.""

Prior to the parade, Putin and Xi held two rounds of talks and an informal chat about the conflict, the BBC reported, citing Chinese media.
Among the other world leaders to attend Friday were Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Slovakia Prime Minister Robert Fico, who was the only European Union leader to head to Moscow, according to the BBC.
The outlet also reported that Chinese troops and contingents of soldiers from North Korea, Vietnam and Mongolia marched through Red Square.
Afterward, Putin shook hands with Russian military officers who led the troops on Red Square and spoke to a group of senior North Korean officers who watched the parade, hugging one of them.

At least 119 Amtrak employees and doctors took the railroad company for a ride in a massive $12 million health fraud scheme, a watchdog found.
Amtrak's Office of Inspector General (OIG) said employees based in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., accepted cash kickbacks from three healthcare providers in exchange for the use of their insurance information and that of their dependents in a scheme from 2019 to 2022.
""The sheer volume of employees who cavalierly participated in this scheme to steal Amtrak’s funds suggests not only a serious lapse in basic ethics, but a troubling workforce culture, at least in the Northeast region, in which blatant criminal behavior was somehow normalized,"" said Amtrak Inspector General Kevin H. Winters.
Fox News Digital has reached out to Amtrak.

The healthcare providers used that employee information to file fraudulent and questionable medical claims for services that were never provided or not medically necessary, the OIG said. Overall, the taxpayer-funded railroad carrier's health plan was billed more than $16 million and was bilked out of $12 million.
Of the 119 employees implicated, 28 retired or resigned as a result of the OIG’s investigation, and 30 left the company for ""other reasons."" Another dozen employees have been criminally charged, and seven have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.
Sixty-one are still on the job.
In a statement to Fox News Digital, Amtrak said it has taken ""significant steps"" to address medical insurance fraud.

""Like many employers, Amtrak calls on medical benefit providers and insurers to do more to identify suspicious activity and stop medical insurance fraud,"" the company said. ""Amtrak strongly condemns this reprehensible act that occurred between 2019 and 2022 and is taking swift action with all active employees involved in the investigation.
""While we continue to work closely with the OIG to identify and stamp out fraud, we also continue to work on other initiatives to address this issue,"" the statement added. ""Amtrak has implemented various measures to enhance fraud prevention and empower employees to report suspected wrongdoing. These efforts include increasing oversight and strengthening efforts to eliminate fraudulent schemes.""

The OIG launched a probe when an agent noticed unusual billing patterns in reports by data analysts. Three New York healthcare providers with ""questionable"" billings who shared a high number of Amtrak employees as patients were identified by investigators.
An undercover agent posing as an Amtrak employee met with Punson Figueroa, aka ""Susie,"" an acupuncturist from Long Island City, New York, June 16, 2021. During the visit, Figueroa told the agent to sign his name 30 times for service without dating the signatures, the OIG said.
Figueroa then submitted alleged fraudulent claims to Amtrak’s healthcare plan, saying the agent had visited providers at least seven times in May 2021 for acupuncture and physical therapy. The agent visited Figueroa’s office again on July 29, 2021, where she allegedly handed him an envelope containing $1,000.
Figueroa continued to use the agent’s insurance information to submit dozens of fraudulent claims to Amtrak’s healthcare plan, investigators said.
Figueroa pleaded guilty to defrauding Amtrak’s healthcare plan, was sentenced to three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay restitution of $9.05 million. Two other healthcare providers and a medical biller have also pleaded guilty for their roles in the scheme.

Michael DeNicola, a podiatrist from New York, pleaded guilty June 29, 2022, to conspiracy to commit health care fraud, distribution of a controlled substance and unlawful possession of a gun. He has not yet been sentenced.
Regina Choi, a medical biller from Woodside, New York, who previously worked for Figueroa, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud June 11, 2024, for submitting false and fraudulent claims to the Amtrak health care plan and paying cash kickbacks to Amtrak employees. Her sentence is also pending.
In 2018 and 2019, OIG auditors issued separate reports that said Amtrak could strengthen measures to identify fraudulent medical claims sooner. Both reports noted billing patterns indicative of potential fraud among hundreds of providers, the OIG said.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/first-american-elected-pontiff-get-know-pope-leo-xiv","First American elected pontiff, get to know Pope Leo XIV","Cardinal Robert Prevost has been elected as the new Pope of the Catholic Church, taking the name Leo XIV. He made his first public appearance at the Vatican to greet the faithful and deliver his inaugural prayer.
Pope Leo XIV, 69, was elected to take up the papal seat on Thursday, on the second day of the papal conclave’s deliberations.
Born Robert Prevost on Sept. 14, 1955 in Chicago, Ill., he was a suspected front-runner to succeed Pope Francis after his passing late last month, though some reporting suggested his being an American could actually count against him due to concerns that the U.S. could further exert its geopolitical prowess through the religious leader.
Leo XIV was first brought to the Vatican by Francis to serve as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops in January 2023, which is one of the most important positions in the Catholic Church as it vets bishop nominations issued globally.

Francis then elevated him to the position of Cardinal in September 2023.
Leo was reported to be closely aligned to Francis's teachings as leader of the Catholic Church, particularly when it came to his positions regarding the environment, outreach to the poor and migrants, and opening the Catholic Church to embrace more followers.
Before making it to the highest position afforded in the Catholic Church, he first entered the novitiate of the Order of Saint Augustine in Saint Louis, in 1977, which essentially marked his period of training before he took his ""holy orders.""
In August 1981, he gave his solemn vows, and by 1982 he was ordained as a priest.
By 1985 he joined the Augustinian mission in Peru, where he served as chancellor of the Territorial Prélature of Chulucanas for one year.

CARDINAL ROBERT PREVOST ANNOUNCED AS FIRST AMERICAN POPE, TAKING NAME LEO XIV
Between 1987 and 1988, he returned to the U.S., where he served as pastor for vocations and director of missions for the Augustinian Province of Chicago, before he returned to Peru for another 10 years to head the Augustinian seminary in Trujillo and teach Cannon Law.
Eventually, he made his way back to his hometown, where, in 1999, he was elected provincial prior of the ""Mother of Good Counsel"" in Chicago.
Leo would go on to be elected twice as leader of the Augustinian religious order, a 13th century order founded by St. Augustine.
He had caught the attention of Francis, who, after becoming pope in 2013, moved Leo back to Peru in 2014 to serve as the administrator and eventually archbishop of Chiclayo.

Leo got his Peruvian citizenship in 2015, where he remained until he was moved to the Vatican in 2023.
During his final years in Peru, Leo also served as vice-president of the permanent council of the Peruvian Bishops’ Conference from 2018 to 2023, which likely helped him secure his role as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops under Francis.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/pakistan-shoots-down-more-than-two-dozen-drones-launched-india","Pakistan shoots down more than two dozen drones launched by India","Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot has the latest on the crisis on 'Special Report.'
India launched multiple Israeli-made Harop drones targeting Pakistan overnight and into Thursday, with one damaging a military site and wounding four soldiers, a Pakistani army spokesman said.
Pakistani forces downed 25 of the drones, Pakistan army spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif told The Associated Press. Debris from a downed drone that fell into the Sindh province killed one civilian and injured another.
A drone damaged a military site near the city of Lahore, injuring four soldiers, and another went down in Rawalpindi, which is near the capital, Sharif said.
""The armed forces are neutralizing them as we speak,"" Sharif said on the state-run Pakistan Television early on Thursday afternoon, the outlet reported.

India’s government said Thursday that overnight, ""Pakistan attempted to engage a number of military targets in Northern and Western India... using drones and missiles.""
""These were neutralized by the Integrated Counter UAS Grid and Air Defense systems. The debris of these attacks is now being recovered from a number of locations that prove the Pakistani attacks,"" it added.
""Indian Armed Forces targeted Air Defense Radars and systems at a number of locations in Pakistan"" this morning, it continued, noting that ""it has been reliably learnt that an Air Defense system at Lahore has been neutralized.""
""Pakistan has increased the intensity of its unprovoked firing across the Line of Control using Mortars and heavy calibre Artillery in areas in Kupwara, Baramulla, Uri, Poonch, Mendhar and Rajouri sectors in Jammu and Kashmir,"" India’s government also said. ""Sixteen innocent lives have been lost, including three women and five children, due to Pakistani firing. Here too, India was compelled to respond to bring Mortar and Artillery fire from Pakistan to a halt.""
Both India and Pakistan are among the handful of world powers that possess nuclear weapons, making tensions between the two nations particularly troublesome on the world stage.
TRUMP OFFERS TO HELP INDIA, PAKISTAN AMID GROWING CONFLICT: ‘I WANT TO SEE THEM STOP’
Late Thursday in Indian-controlled Kashmir, residents of the city of Jammu reported hearing explosions and sirens.
Shesh Paul Vaid, the region’s former director-general of police, said there was a complete blackout in Jammu following loud blasts. Vaid told The Associated Press that the Jammu Airport likely was under attack and that some of the 50 loud explosions he heard likely were because ""our defense system is at work.""
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also spoke Thursday to Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif.
""The Secretary emphasized the need for immediate de-escalation. He expressed U.S. support for direct dialogue between India and Pakistan and encouraged continued efforts to improve communications,"" according to the State Department.
""The Secretary expressed sorrow for the reported loss of civilian lives in the current conflict. He reiterated his calls for Pakistan to take concrete steps to end any support for terrorist groups,"" it added.
President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he wants the conflict between the two nations to ""stop,"" noting, ""if I can do anything to help … I will be there.""
Some American lawmakers have also weighed in on India and Pakistan.

(Vatican Media)
The Vatican announced the election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope in the history of the Catholic Church, shortly after white smoke began pouring from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel on Thursday.
Cardinal Protodeacon Dominique Mamberti announced Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost's election as pope to the thousands of faithful who descended on St. Peter's Square after the 133 voting cardinals deliberated in the Sistine Chapel for roughly 24 hours.
Prevost, a 69-year-old Augustinian, appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica wearing the traditional red cape of the papacy — a cape that Pope Francis had chosen not to wear after his election in 2013.
His first words as pope were ""Peace be with you,"" which he said in Italian, and delivered a message to the faithful building bridges, peace and dialogue ""without fear."" Prevost then switched to Spanish to recall his years as a missionary and later archbishop of Chiclayo, Peru. He did not deliver any words in English.

Francis brought Prevost to the Vatican in 2023 to serve as the powerful head of the office that vets bishop nominations from around the world, one of the most important jobs in the Catholic Church. As a result, Prevost had a prominence going into the conclave that few other cardinals have.
Prevost was born on Sept. 14, 1955, in Chicago. He is also a citizen of Peru, where he lived for years as a missionary and later as an archbishop.
He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Villanova University in 1977 before taking his solemn vows and studying theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago in 1982.

White smoke was witnessed emerging from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel on Thursday, in a direct signal that a new pope has already been elected.
The name of the pope has yet to be announced by the papal conclave, who met for the first time on Wednesday to deliberate on who would take up the seat as leader of the Catholic Church.

THE COLLEGE OF CARDINALS MEET TO ELECT THE NEXT POPE. WHO WILL IT BE?
Only one vote was intended to be held on the first day of the conclave’s gathering, while as many as four votes could be held in the following days, with two ballots collected in the morning followed by up to two in the afternoon.
The Thursday announcement means the holy body concluded their voting on the second day; both Pope Francis and Pope Benedict were elected on the second day of the Conclave.
The last time a conclave agreed on a pope on the first day, just hours after convening, was in 1503 with the election of Pope Julius II, according to the Associated Press.

In recent years, the conclave has still been considered relatively quick in their decision as they reached a conclusion on the papacy in just a matter of days.
Pope Francis was elected in 2013 on the fifth ballot, while Pope Benedict XVI won in 2005 on the fourth ballot, and Pope Pius XII, elected in 1939 won on the third ballot.

A pope is decided after a man receives a two-thirds majority by the voting body, which comprises eligible voters in the College of Cardinals who are under the age of 80 at the time of the pope's passing.
Of the 252 members of the body, 133 of the cardinals voted.

Once the individual, who is traditionally selected from the College of Cardinals, is chosen as the next pope, he must accept the role with the Dean of the College.
He will then be asked by what name he would like to be called, and the conclave then concludes.

David Perdue was sworn in as U.S. ambassador to China May 7, 2025, with President Donald Trump remarking on the timing of the ceremony as trade talks between the two nations are set to kick off.
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin met for formal talks on Thursday for the first time since President Donald Trump exacerbated the U.S.-China trade war last month.
In a statement at the top of the meeting, Xi pledged to stand by his anti-Western ally against ""power politics"" and ""bullying on the international stage.""
""Eighty years ago, the peoples of China and Russia made tremendous sacrifices to secure a great victory, contributing an indelible chapter to the cause of world peace and human progress,"" Xi said, according to a report by the South China Morning Post.

""Today, in the face of unilateralist backflows and acts of power politics and bullying on the international stage, China will join Russia in shouldering our special responsibilities as major countries and permanent members of the U.N. Security Council,"" he added.
The pair met on what is considered Victory Day in Europe, which marks the beginning of the end of World War II, when the Allied nations accepted the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, though Russia celebrates the anniversary one day later.
Japan did not surrender until September 1945, though Xi and Putin convened for a joint celebration which will take place in Moscow’s Red Square on Friday and will include a large contingent of Chinese troops. Leaders from 20 nations, including Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula de Silva, will also reportedly be in attendance.
While Xi appeared to take direct aim at the U.S., which under Trump has slapped 145% tariffs on all Chinese exports, Putin’s language was more toned down when he said, ""We are developing our ties in the interests of both our peoples and not aimed against anyone.""
Putin and Xi first expanded their relationship just ahead of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in the West’s attempt to isolate Moscow in retaliation for the deadly war.

US OFFICIALS TO MEET WITH CHINESE COUNTERPARTS IN SWITZERLAND AMID TRADE WAR
Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have since deepened ties in an alliance that has increasingly concerned Western partners, though the Trump administration has looked to step away from these divisions in what some have argued could weaken U.S. ties with Washington’s long-standing allies.
Putin said the ties strengthened during its war years were ""one of the fundamental foundations of modern Russian-Chinese relations"".
""Together with our Chinese friends, we firmly stand guard over the historical truth, protect the memory of the events of the war years, and counteract modern manifestations of neo-Nazism and militarism,"" he added in reference to one of his long-debunked claims used to justify his illegal invasion of Ukraine.
According to Russian news outlet TASS, both Xi and Putin pledged to help play a role in the Trump administration’s push to form a new nuclear agreement with Iran.
While both were key players in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Trump abandoned in 2018, it remains unclear how they intend to participate in this round of negotiations facilitated by Oman.

""The parties intend to play an active creative role in the settlement around the Iranian nuclear program, emphasizing that it will contribute to maintaining the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, peace and stability in the Middle East,"" the readout said.
The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s questions regarding any potential China-Russia involvement in the talks.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/satellite-images-reveal-alleged-secret-iranian-nuclear-weapons-facility","Satellite images reveal alleged secret Iranian nuclear weapons facility","Fox News State Department correspondent Gillian Turner has the latest on the discovery of an alleged Iranian nuclear facility on ‘America’s Newsroom.’
Fox News has exclusively obtained satellite imagery revealing what an opposition group says is a previously undisclosed Iranian nuclear weapons facility — raising fresh concerns amid ongoing negotiations between Tehran and the Trump administration.
The newly identified site, located in Iran’s Semnan Province, is far from the regime's already-known nuclear facilities. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), intelligence gathered from sources inside the country points to a sprawling compound covering nearly 2,500 acres.
Code-named the ""Rainbow Site"" by Iranian officials, the facility has reportedly been in operation for more than a decade, masked as a chemical production company known as Diba Energy Siba.

According to NCRI sources, the primary function of the Rainbow Site is the extraction of tritium — a radioactive isotope used to enhance nuclear weapons. Unlike uranium enrichment, tritium has virtually no peaceful or commercial applications, casting further doubt on Iran’s longstanding claims that its nuclear ambitions are solely for energy or civilian use.
The revelations come as the Trump administration navigates sensitive negotiations with Tehran. When asked about the U.S. position on whether Iran can maintain a nuclear enrichment program short of weapons development, President Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday, ""We haven’t made that decision yet. We will, but we haven’t made that decision yet.""
Despite the bombshell intelligence, senior officials maintain optimism. Vice President JD Vance, speaking Tuesday, said the talks remain on track.

""Without prejudging the negotiation, I will say, so far, so good,"" Vance told reporters. ""We’ve been very happy with how the Iranians have responded to some of the points that we’ve made.""

The discovery of the Rainbow Site could complicate the already delicate diplomacy surrounding Iran’s nuclear capabilities and the possibility of a renewed agreement.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/eisenhowers-great-grandson-warns-holocaust-denial-rising-80-years-after-wwii-europe-ended","Eisenhower’s great-grandson warns Holocaust denial is rising 80 years after WWII in Europe ended","Tova Friedman recalls what she endured in Auschwitz and is joined by her grandson Aron Goodman to discuss the ‘frightening’ surge in antisemitism in America.
Eighty years after the Holocaust, far too many people are either downplaying its severity or denying it altogether, warned Merrill Eisenhower Atwater, great-grandson of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
His remarks came as nations around the world on Thursday commemorated the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day.
On May 8, 1945, Nazi Germany formally surrendered to the Allied powers, bringing an end to the war in Europe—a conflict that claimed the lives of approximately 40 million people, including the extermination of 6 million Jews.
Last month, Eisenhower Atwater took part in the March of the Living on Holocaust Remembrance Day, walking alongside survivors and thousands of participants from around the world. The march traces the path from Auschwitz to Birkenau, the Nazi death camps in occupied Poland, in a solemn tribute to the victims and in honor of the survivors and their liberators.
""When you’re sitting with 80 Holocaust survivors and both you and they are crying because of how special the moment is—and they tell you, ‘Without your great-grandfather, this never would have happened’—I say, without your bravery, this never would have happened,"" Eisenhower Atwater told Fox News Digital on Wednesday,
ISRAEL PAUSES AS THE JEWISH STATE HONORS AND REMEMBERS VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST

Eisenhower, commander in chief of the European Allied forces, and his soldiers discovered 70 prisoners who had been shot down in the courtyard in Germany on April 4. (Photo by Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images)
""One person equals multiple lives that were saved. It wasn’t just the liberation of the camps—it was saving generations,"" he added.
Among the march’s participants was Israel Meir Lau, former chief rabbi of Israel and a child survivor of Buchenwald, who personally met Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who led the Allied offensive against the Nazis in Europe, during the camp’s liberation.
Also remembered was Chaim Herzog, father of Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who was on hand for the march. A British army officer during World War II, Chaim Herzog played a role in liberating the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. His father, Yitzhak Isaac Halevi Herzog—who would also become a chief rabbi of Israel—met with Gen. Eisenhower in 1946 as part of a mission to aid Jewish survivors across postwar Europe.
Eisenhower Atwater called his inclusion ""humbling"" and said the march allowed him to ""sit and talk with unsung heroes.""

One survivor in particular, Eva Clarke, left a deep impression. ""She’s one of the kindest souls I’ve ever met. Finding out that the gas ran out just a couple days before she was born—that’s divine intervention,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""She led the way. Just an incredible woman with an incredible story. She should inspire everyone.""
Clarke was born on April 29, 1945 at the gates of Mauthausen concentration camp, one of only three known babies to have survived birth there.
Clarke’s mother, Anka Kauderova, endured three and a half years in concentration camps: Theresienstadt in then-Czechoslovakia, Auschwitz, and the Freiberg slave labor camp and armament factory in Germany. She was eventually transported in open coal wagons, along with 2,000 other prisoners, on a grueling 17-day journey without food and with minimal water to Mauthausen.
ISRAELI PRESIDENT HERZOG HIGHLIGHTS ANTISEMITISM IN UN SPEECH AS NEW REPORT SHOWS SHOCKING TREND
""My parents were in Theresienstadt for three years, which was unusually long. They were young, strong, and able to work. To some extent, it was a transit camp to a death camp,"" Clarke told Fox News Digital.
""At the end of September 1944, their luck ran out. My father was sent to Auschwitz, and incredibly, my mother volunteered to follow him the next day. She didn’t know where he was going and, ever the optimist, believed it couldn’t get worse and they’d survive,"" she said.
Anka never saw her husband again. An eyewitness later told her that he was shot and killed in the death march near Auschwitz on Jan. 18, 1945. Auschwitz was liberated by the Russian army on Jan. 27.
In 1943, Anka became pregnant. ""It was dangerous, but she met my father secretly. Becoming pregnant in a concentration camp was considered a crime punishable by death,"" Clarke said.

Her brother was born in February 1944 but died of pneumonia two months later. ""Had my mother arrived at Auschwitz with a baby in her arms, both would have been sent to the gas chamber. Nobody knew she was pregnant again—with me.""
In April 1945, Anka was sent to Mauthausen. ""It’s a beautiful village on the Danube in Austria, but the camp sits on a steep hill behind it. When my mother saw the name at the train station, she was shocked—she had heard how horrific it was. That shock likely triggered her labor, and she began giving birth to me,"" Clarke said.
She credits her survival to timing. ""On April 28, the Nazis ran out of gas. I was born on April 29. Hitler committed suicide on April 30. On May 5, the American 11th Armored Division liberated the camp.""
When the Americans arrived, they brought food and medicine—though many, weakened, died upon receiving them. Three weeks later, once Anka regained strength, U.S. forces repatriated her to Prague. There, Anka met her second husband, and the two left to avoid living under communism, eventually settling in the U.K.

""I feel Merrill is my new best friend,"" Clarke said of Eisenhower Atwater. ""It was overwhelming to meet someone whose great-grandfather played such an important role in ending the war. I was delighted to reconnect with him again in Auschwitz a few weeks ago. Everyone wanted to thank him for what his great-grandfather did.""
Clarke will return to Mauthausen this Sunday to mark the 80th anniversary of its liberation by U.S. forces. ""I’ll be there with two other babies who were born under similar circumstances. We are so grateful, I can’t even express it,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Reflecting on the moral clarity his great-grandfather exemplified, Eisenhower Atwater underscored that we are all human beings first.
""We all know right from wrong. It is wrong to kill people, wrong to put babies in ovens, wrong to put people in gas chambers. That’s clear,"" he said.
He acknowledged that Holocaust denial often stems from disbelief. ""It’s easy to say something didn’t happen because it’s hard to comprehend the death of that many people. I get that. But it did happen. Nazi Germans killed 10,000 people a day—it’s well-documented. They documented it themselves, and the Allied forces saw it first-hand.
""Nobody really wants to talk about the death of six million people over a five-to-six-year period,"" he added. ""But it’s the truth.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-halts-military-strikes-houthis-expert-warns-iran-backed-terrorist-group-remains-major-threat","Trump halts military strikes on Houthis but expert warns Iran-backed terrorist group remains major threat","President Trump teased a ""very, very big announcement"" ahead of his trip to the Middle East, as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was ""on the edge of my seat.""
President Donald Trump made the surprise announcement this week that the U.S., after weeks of intense strikes, will halt all bombing campaigns on the Houthis in Yemen – but experts have warned the Iran-backed group will not sit idle.
In Trump’s Tuesday announcement from the Oval Office, he claimed the Houthis ""just don't want to fight…and we will honor that. We will stop the bombings.""
The president would not say who provided him with this confirmation by the terrorist network, which for years has attacked U.S. and allied ships in the Red Sea in a major threat to freedom of navigation, but in a laugh following the question, he replied that it came from a ""very good source.""
Less than two hours later, Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, the foreign minister of Oman, took to X to say, ""Following recent discussions and contacts conducted by the Sultanate of Oman with the United States and the relevant authorities in Sana'a, in the Republic of Yemen, with the aim of de-escalation, efforts have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides.""
TRUMP CLAIMS HOUTHIS 'DON'T WANT TO FIGHT' AND SAYS US WILL STOP BOMBING CAMPAIGN

""In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping,"" he added.
The post suggests that Oman, which has also played an intermediary in the U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, was heavily involved in securing the ceasefire.
However, a new report obtained by Fox News Digital ahead of the president’s surprise announcement warns that the Trump administration must remain vigilant against major security threats posed by the Houthis and the international actors supporting the terrorist network.
The report, dubbed ""The Houthi Challenge: Forging a Strategy to Defeat the Iran-Backed Terror Group in Yemen"" by Ari Heistein for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and research fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, highlighted that it is not only Iran that have helped facilitate the Houthi operational capabilities.
While Tehran has backed the Houthis since at least 2014 – and possibly as early as 2009 during the war in Yemen – through training and advanced weapons like ballistic missiles, Oman has also played a role by allowing the group to operate from its territory and serving as a key smuggling route for Iranian arms.

Jonathan Schanzer, a former terrorism finance analyst at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the current executive director of the FDD, called Oman's role in negotiations between Washington and Middle East adversaries ""outrageous.""
""To hold them up as responsible intermediaries when they are in fact hosting the very group that we're trying to dismantle, there's very little logic [in] this position,"" he told Fox News Digital.
The report found that Iranian arms are smuggled into Yemen through the port of Hodeidah – which was targeted in a series of Israeli strikes on major infrastructure in and around the Houthi-controlled capital of Sana’a this week – but also through smaller ports or overland through Oman.
Omani private banking institutions and businesses are also reportedly known to be ""servicing the Houthi economy and even supplying the group with arms.""
""More must be done to prevent bulk cash smuggling across the border between Oman and Yemen,"" Heistein found. ""Muscat must begin to feel pressure from the international community to address a threat finance challenge that has gone unchecked for too long.""
The report breaks down the varied steps that need to be taken to effectively undermine and counter the Houthis as repeated military strikes by first, Saudi Arabia starting in 2015, then recently by the U.S. and Israel, have not significantly degraded the terrorist group.

Those steps include continued military action – similar to Israel’s recent strikes on Yemen’s Hodeidah port and Sana’a International Airport, which are expected to have far-reaching economic impacts and increase internal pressure on the Houthis. But military action alone isn’t enough; economic, diplomatic, and other soft power strategies are also needed to weaken the group, according to the report.
The report also highlighted that the Houthis have utilized previous lulls in fighting with nations like Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and Israel to regroup and rebuild.

""Compelling the Houthis to halt attacks on shipping is a meaningful achievement only if it is part of a broader, long-term strategy,"" Heistein told Fox News Digital. ""However, if a Red Sea ceasefire becomes the centerpiece and endpoint of U.S. policy toward the Houthis, it risks empowering an increasingly dangerous regime to escalate and de-escalate at will.
""Without a comprehensive approach to addressing the Houthi threat, the U.S. and its allies could soon be confronting a more dangerous, better-armed terrorist group,"" Heinstein warned.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korea-launches-short-range-ballistic-missiles-sea-south-korea-says","North Korea launches short-range ballistic missiles into sea, South Korea says","During a press conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, President Trump said relations with North Korea will happen.
North Korea launched several short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern sea Thursday in what South Korea is calling a ""clear act of provocation.""
Lee Sung Joon, a spokesperson for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the launches were possibly intended to test the performance of weapons that North Korea plans to export as it continues to send military equipment and troops to fuel Russia’s warfighting against Ukraine.
The agency said multiple missiles were launched from an area around North Korea’s eastern port city of Wonsan from about 8:10 to 9:20 a.m. local time Thursday, with the farthest traveling about 497 miles.
Lee said the tests likely involved a short-range ballistic missile system launched from vehicles — possibly modeled after Russia’s Iskander missile -- and also large-caliber rocket artillery systems.

The Joint Chiefs said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities detected the launch preparations in advance and tracked the missiles after they were launched.
It issued a statement denouncing the launches as a ""clear act of provocation"" that threatens peace and stability in the region, according to the Associated Press. South Korean military officials are now analyzing whether the tests were linked to the North’s weapons exports to Russia.
In early March, North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea just hours after South Korea and the United States kicked off their first major joint military exercise of President Donald Trump’s second term.
""We are aware of the DPRK’s multiple ballistic missile launches and are consulting closely with the Republic of Korea and Japan, as well as other regional allies and partners. The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,"" the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement at the time.

Those launches come after South Korean and U.S. forces began their annual Freedom Shield exercise.
After denying its war involvement for months, North Korea last month confirmed for the first time that it had sent combat troops to help Russia in recapturing parts of the Kursk region, which had fallen to a surprise Ukrainian incursion last year. Moscow also acknowledged the North Korean involvement, with Russian President Vladimir Putin issuing a statement thanking the North for sending troops to support his forces and promising not to forget their sacrifices.

Recent South Korean intelligence assessments suggest that North Korea has sent about 15,000 soldiers to Russia, and that nearly 5,000 of them have been killed or injured while fighting against Ukrainian forces, the AP reported. Washington and Seoul have also accused North Korea of supplying Russia with various types of military equipment, including artillery systems and shells and ballistic missiles.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/papal-conclave-eventual-new-popes-chosen-name-may-signal-whats-ahead","Papal conclave: Eventual new pope's chosen name may signal what's ahead","Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris watches the black smoke pour out of the Sistine Chapel as no pope is selected in the first round of votes on 'The Story.'
Once a new pope is voted in, the name he chooses could signal the direction the Catholic Church moves in the coming years.
The announcement ""Habemus Papa,"" or, ""We have a pope,"" will be made from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica. It will then be followed by the pontiff’s baptismal name in Latin, along with his chosen papal name and meaning.
Should the pope choose to go with Pope Francis II, it could signify continuity with the late pontiff’s pastoral legacy, though Francis himself quipped that whoever succeeds him would be John XXIV, named after the Vatican II-era pope.
In the 20th century, the most popular name for popes was Pius, and if chosen, that could signal that a traditionalist is taking back the throne of St. Peter.

""In the deepest recesses of their mind, when they start the conclave, everyone will walk in there with a name in their head,"" Natalia Imperatori-Lee, chair of religious studies at Manhattan University, told The Associated Press.
For the majority of the Church’s first 1,000 years, popes used their given names, though the first exception was Roman Mercurius in the 6th century, who was named for a pagan god and chose the name John II.
Adopting a name became common practice during the 11th century, a period of German popes who chose the names of early bishops out of a ""desire to signify continuity,"" Rev. Roberto Regoli, a historian at Rome’s Pontifical Gregorian University, told the wire service.

It was not until the mid-20th century that new popes began to choose names signaling the direction of their papacy, Regoli added.
""Even now, as we are waiting for the new pope, the name with which he will present himself will help us to understand the horizon towards which he wants to proceed,"" Regoli said.
Names like Urban and Innocent have not been used for centuries, and Imperatori-Lee said he did not think anyone would pick the latter, given the abuse and scandals that have rocked the church.

""I don’t think that would be the right choice,"" he said.
The most recent names chosen include Francis, Benedict and John Paul.
The AP said Francis signaled a papacy focused on those who are often seen as outsiders, including the poor, prisoners and the LGBTQ+ community, while promoting peace, brotherhood and care for the environment.

Benedict, who was elected in 2005, was chosen because he wanted to pay homage to Benedict XV, who led the Catholic Church during World War I and dedicated himself to healing the rifts of war.
John Paul chose his name, signaling a commitment to reforms, including the sidelining of the Latin Mass in favor of local languages and other faiths, most significantly Judaism.
But it is still a new pope’s choice to choose a name never used before.
""This would open a new season and could mean that his program is not in line with any of his predecessors, so an even more personalized program,"" Regoli said.

Imperatori-Lee suggested another name that might signal a continuation of Francis’ legacy: Ignatius, for the founder of Francis’ Jesuit order.
""It would be interesting,"" she said. ""We’ve never had one of those.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/antisemitism-spiking-around-world-adl-task-force-finds-its-1st-ever-global-report","Antisemitism spiking around the world, ADL task force finds in its 1st-ever global report","ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt and ADL Senior VP of Counter-Extremism and Intelligence Oren Segal spoke with Fox News Digital about the organization's bombshell report.
The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has released its first-ever J7 Annual Report on Antisemitism as the world prepares to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day.
The report details the rise in antisemitism seen in countries that have the largest Jewish populations outside Israel, including the U.S., the U.K., Argentina, Canada, France, Germany and Australia.
The J7 Task Force was founded in July 2023, just months before Hamas launched its deadly attacks on Israel. In the wake of the massacre, the ADL has noted an uptick in antisemitic incidents and sentiments around the world.

ANTISEMITIC INCIDENTS BREAK RECORD FOR 4TH STRAIGHT YEAR, ADL FINDS
From 2021 to 2023, antisemitic incidents increased by 11% in Australia, 23% in Argentina, 75% in Germany, 82% in the U.K., 83% in Canada, 185% in France and 227% in the U.S., according to the ADL’s report. Additionally, the organization noted a ""troubling"" pattern in antisemitic incidents per Jewish capita in the J7 countries, including more than 38 incidents per 1,000 Jewish residents in Germany in 2023. Additionally, in Australia, incidents per Jewish capita quadrupled from 2023 to 2024.
The J7 Task Force report reveals common themes across all nations, such as increases in violent attacks, spikes in antisemitic rhetoric online and growing feelings of fear and insecurity among Jews.
In the report, the rising antisemitism in each of the J7 countries was documented by the Jewish communities directly impacted.
The Delegación de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentinas (DAIA) found that antisemitism had become deeply embedded in social media and academic institutions. Argentinian Jewish students are reportedly choosing schools ""based on whether or not they will be a target of antisemitic incidents, both from their fellow students and from their professors,"" according to DAIA. The organization recommends more ""work and engagement"" in combatting antisemitism in academia.
In 2023, Argentina saw a 44% increase in antisemitic incidents compared to 2022. Like many other countries included in the report, the country saw a rise in antisemitism and anti-Zionism following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks.
Additionally, DAIA noted that Argentinian President Javier Milei’s strong support of Israel and the U.S. has led to ""an increase in antisemitic and other conspiratorial rhetoric.""
DAIA also found some bright spots in Argentina, noting that 60% of Argentinians, especially those aged 25-34, have a favorable view of Israel and just 7% favor boycotting Israeli products and businesses. This could be because Argentina has felt the impact of a terrorist organization that has also attacked Israel. Hezbollah carried out two deadly bombing attacks in Buenos Aires, one in 1992 at the Israeli Embassy and another in 1994 at the AMIA-DAIA Jewish Center.

AUSTRALIA'S JEWISH COMMUNITY ALARMED BY RISING ANTISEMITISM
The Executive Council of Australian Jewry’s (ECAJ) report, which covers Oct. 1, 2023-Sept. 30, 2024, showed a sizable 316% increase in antisemitic incidents. In the 12-month period the ECAJ studied, it found 2,062 antisemitic incidents compared to 495 incidents in the previous year. In the decade prior, the number of antisemitic incidents each year ranged from 190 to 495.
ECAJ cited Dr. Adina Bankier-Karp and Dr. David Graham’s survey, ""Australian Jews in the Shadow of War,"" which found that 64% of Australian Jews felt that antisemitism was ""very much"" a big problem in the country. This, according to the report, is 10 times higher than the response in 2017.
The Australian federal government in 2024, as well as many state governments, banned hate symbols such as swastikas and the Nazi salute. Symbols of terrorist organizations were also banned. However, ECAJ said it does not believe these laws do enough to combat ""post-Oct. 7 sources of antisemitism.""
""While these laws are welcomed, they are not addressing the post-October 7 sources of antisemitism in Australia which makes up the majority of incidents, nor will the laws counter anti-Jewish attitudes and incidents,"" ECAJ wrote in the report.
The report on Canada was compiled by the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA). The organization said Canada’s main challenges include increased threats of violence and ""anti- Israel actions taken by the federal government that display a double standard towards the Jewish state, such as the imposition of an arms embargo.""
While the data for 2024 is not yet available, CIJA noted that the 2023 statistics show ""disturbing trends."" While Jews make up just 1% of the country’s population, 19% of reported hate crimes were motivated by antisemitism. Additionally, hate crimes against Jews increased by 71% from 2022 to 2023, according to CIJA.
In the report, CIJA called out the Canadian government’s ""inaction"" on antisemitism. The organization called for action and legal reform to help fight rising antisemitism.
Nearly all Canadian Jews, 98%, said antisemitism is a ""serious or somewhat serious problem,"" according to CIJA. Additionally, 82% said ""Canada has become less safe for Jews"" since Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre.

Conseil Représentatif des Institutions Juives de France (CRIF) found clear links between antisemitic incidents and the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. According to CRIF, more than 30% of antisemitic incidents in 2024 included references to ""Palestine."" French schools also saw antisemitic incidents more than quadruple, reaching 1,670 in the 2023-2024 academic year, compared to 400 the year before.
CRIF found that antisemitic incidents became more violent in 2024. These incidents included the rape and assault of a 12-year-old Jewish girl because of her ""bad words on Palestine"" and the arson and antisemitic graffiti at the Rouen synagogue.
The organization said it welcomed the French government’s adoption of a national plan to fight racism, antisemitism and discrimination. The plan was adopted in 2023 and is set to be implemented through 2026.
CRIF said in its report that many French Jews have stopped displaying or speaking about their religious identity out of fear. Even children steer clear of the topic to avoid harassment in school.
GLOBAL RISE IN ANTISEMITISM LEAVES JEWISH COMMUNITY ISOLATED, RABBI SAYS WORLD AT 'A TIPPING POINT'
Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland (ZJD) sounded the alarm over rising antisemitism, pointing out that ""October 7, 2023, has massively accelerated a development that was already looming."" Antisemitism in Germany is not unique to one side of the political aisle, though ZJD points out the rise of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) ""poses a major challenge.""
AfD holds multiple positions that, if turned into reality, would make life extremely difficult for observant German Jews, including the banning of religious slaughter of animals, which could effectively make kosher meat illegal.
German police found 3,200 crimes from Jan. 1, 2024, to Oct. 7, 2024, were motivated by antisemitism. This comes after the Office on Research and Information on Antisemitism in Hessen found 3,000 antisemitic incidents between Oct. 7, 2023, and the end of that same year.
A January 2025 study by the Claims Conference found that approximately 40% of 18- to 29-year-olds in Germany did not know that more than 6,000,000 Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. However, the ADL’s 2024 Global 100 survey shows Holocaust distortion and denial is lower in Germany compared to other Western European nations.
ZJD concluded that ongoing debates in Germany surrounding social issues have direct impacts on the Jewish community.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews (the Board) said in its section of the report that antisemitism has dropped since Q4 2023 but still remains above pre-Oct. 7 levels. Meanwhile, British Jews are ""finding everyday life in the U.K. an increasing challenge"" with 25% of British Jews feeling unsafe in the country.
The Community Security Trust’s 2024 Antisemitic Incidents Report showed 3,528 antisemitic incidents in the U.K., representing an 18% decrease from the 4,296 incidents reported in 2023.
""Posters of Israeli hostages are regularly torn down, and in major cities the UK has faced weekly hate marches calling for Israel’s destruction,"" the Board wrote. It also stated that the Institute of Jewish Policy Research called this phenomenon ""ambient antisemitism.""
The Board acknowledged the government’s actions to fight antisemitism but said that statistics showed that further action was needed. ""Enhanced law enforcement, stricter regulations on online hate speech, and comprehensive educational programs are essential to effectively combat antisemitic attitudes and behaviors,"" the Board wrote.
Overall, the Board believes the U.K.’s three main areas of focus should be addressing antisemitic incidents, fighting online hate speech and restoring a sense of security among British Jews.

The ADL and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations worked together to compile a report on rising antisemitism in the U.S., noting the ""alarming rise"" in antisemitic incidents and attitudes.
In its 2024 antisemitism audit, which was released last month, the ADL identified 9,354 antisemitic incidents in 2024, a 5% increase from 2023 and a staggering 926% increase since it began tracking in 1979.
""Let’s be clear, antisemitism is an irrational hatred of individuals or institutions just because they are Jewish,"" ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt told Fox News Digital upon the release of the audit. He also noted that ""ADL has been conducting an annual audit of antisemitic incidents since the 1970s. And we've simply never seen numbers like this.""
The ADL and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations found that ""the groundswell of antisemitism in the United States shows no signs of abating."" In the report, both organizations said that the polarized political environment makes it hard to predict how antisemitism will develop.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/pakistan-calls-indias-strikes-act-war-claims-shot-down-indian-fighter-jets","Pakistan calls India's strikes an 'act of war' and claims it shot down Indian fighter jets","Pakistan is claiming to have shot down multiple Indian fighter jets Wednesday after India launched airstrikes against the country. (Credit: APTN)
Pakistan is calling airstrikes launched by India an ""act of war"" Wednesday, with its military claiming it shot down five Indian fighter jets in retaliation.
The strikes targeted at least nine sites ""where terrorist attacks against India have been planned,"" India’s Defense Ministry said. Pakistan's military said the missiles hit six locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in the country’s eastern Punjab province, killing at least 26 people, including women and children.
""Pakistan has every right to give a robust response to this act of war imposed by India, and a strong response is indeed being given,"" Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared.
Tensions have soared between the nuclear-armed neighbors since an April attack in which gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, in the India-controlled portion of Kashmir. India accuses its neighbor of being behind that attack, which was claimed by a militant group calling itself Kashmir Resistance that India says is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba, a disbanded Pakistani militant group.

Indian military officials said Wednesday that their forces targeted ""terrorist camps"" that served as recruitment centers and weapon storage facilities for Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, another Islamist militant group.
Indian sources told Fox News the country is now pushing for de-escalation following the strikes.
""The trigger was the terrorist attack, we had a right to respond and we responded…for us, that’s where this particular matter ends,"" the official source said. ""What Pakistan does now is up to them.""
The official source describes communications with U.S. officials as ""fast and smooth,"" saying ""we have had overwhelming support from the Administration, Senators and Members of Congress."" The official source cited more than 40 senators posted on X condemning the April 22 terror attacks, and that 118 members of Congress did as well.
Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif, Pakistan’s military spokesperson, said the country’s air force shot down five Indian jets in retaliation. The Indian source would not comment on those claims, saying India is still assessing the situation.
Three planes fell onto villages in India-controlled territory, and there was a heavy exchange of fire between the sides, the Associated Press reported. At least seven civilians were also killed in the region by Pakistani shelling, Indian police and medics said.
Debris from one plane was scattered across Wuyan village on the outskirts of Kashmir’s main city of Srinagar, including in a school and a mosque compound, police and residents said.
""There was a huge fire in the sky. Then we heard several blasts also,"" Wuyan resident Mohammed Yousuf told the AP.

Another aircraft fell in an open field in Bhardha Kalan village. Resident Sachin Kumar told the AP he heard massive blasts and saw a huge ball of fire.
""We found the two pilots at some distance in injured condition. They were Indian pilots and soldiers took them away,"" he added.

""Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature,"" India’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. ""No Pakistan military facilities have been targeted.""

The leader of the Roman Catholic Church does not get paid what many consider a traditional salary. Instead, the Vatican provides for the pontiff's needs, from housing, food, transportation and other expenses in the form of stipends and allowances.
The Vatican, referred to as ""the world's smallest country,"" is sustained by ""an economy that relies on a combination of donations, private enterprises, and investments to generate revenue,"" according to Investopedia.
Pope Francis declined any sort of salary when he took office in 2013, The Economic Times reported back in February, adding that the pontiff at the time had a net worth of ""around $16 million, which includes various assets provided to him as the pope.""
The Vatican's financial situation has been in peril for years, with its annual operating deficit growing to over $90 million in 2023, according to reports. In November, Pope Francis warned that the Vatican's pension fund — which provides pensions to employees of the Holy See and Vatican City State — has been facing a ""severe prospective imbalance"" that ""tends to grow over time in the absence of interventions,"" according to the Vatican News.

The governing body of the Vatican, also known as the Holy See, doesn't provide exact numbers regarding its finances. However, the Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook estimated its revenues and expenditures in 2013 notched $315 million and $348 million, respectively.
It generates this money through various avenues. According to the Michigan Journal of Economics, the Holy See generates some of its revenue through Peter’s Pence, which is a term that describes donations collected from Catholics around the world and given to the Pope on an annual basis. This accounts for $27 million each year, with the largest contributions deriving from the United States, Germany and Italy, according to American Magazine.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/family-american-hostage-tortured-lebanon-wins-landmark-case-against-iran","Family of American hostage tortured in Lebanon wins landmark case against Iran","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
After a nearly four-year search for justice, a U.S. court has found in favor of the family of a Lebanese American man held hostage in Lebanon, finding that the Islamic Republic of Iran, working through its proxy Hezbollah, should be held liable for their father’s kidnap and torture.
Two of Amer Fakhoury’s daughters, Guila and Zoya Fakhoury, told Fox News Digital that on May 1, a U.S. District Court judge found Iran responsible for Fakhoury’s imprisonment.
""This is the first lawsuit to prove Iran’s influence over Lebanon,"" Guila said. ""We were very happy about the judgment.""
‘HOSTAGE IN LEBANON:’ NEW HAMPSHIRE FAMILY RECOUNTS FATHER’S DETAINMENT, TORTURE IN NEW BOOK
During President Trump's first term, his administration helped secure the release of New Hampshire businessman Amer Fakhoury. (Fakhoury Family)
Amer Fakhoury was arrested a week after traveling to Lebanon with his family in September 2019. After his arrest, a newspaper linked with Hezbollah alleged that Fakhoury, formerly a member of the South Lebanon Army, had been the ""butcher"" of Khiam, a detention center where grave human rights abuses were reported to have taken place.
Though he was released from a military prison in December 2019, it was only after the Lebanese Supreme Court dropped charges against Fakhoury in March 2020 that he was able to return to the U.S. By the time of his return, Fakhoury had lost 60 pounds and was suffering from late-stage lymphoma, along with rib fractures and other health complications. He died in September 2020 at the age of 57.
Proving Fakhoury’s suffering and torture was a battle for the family, though Guila said the State Department’s classification of her father as a hostage was instrumental in proving the nature of Fakhoury’s captivity.

Proving that Iran was behind the imprisonment was more difficult. In fact, while Guila said some people ""kind of laughed"" that the family blamed Iran for their father’s mistreatment, Zoya said ""Iran’s influence in Lebanon in recent years further proves our point.""
Because Iran never responded to the suit, Guila said the family was forced to provide evidence her father witnessed of Hezbollah’s control over ""every government agency in Lebanon,"" including the military hospital, military court, and the Lebanese General Directorate of General Security, the country’s intelligence apparatus that Guila said arrested and tortured Fakhoury.

Even when the Lebanese judicial system found Fakhoury innocent of multiple false charges that he was a killer, a terrorist and an Israeli agent, Guila said officials told Fakhoury that they had to keep him ""because Hezbollah wants [him] in prison.""
Fakhoury’s family faced difficulties even before filing their case in May 2021. Zoya says Hezbollah officials in Lebanon have been issuing threats to the family since Fakhoury’s death. In addition to Iran failing to respond to the suit, Guila said Lebanese General Directorate of General Security officials interfered with the lawsuit by asking to have their names and agencies removed. She says the judge denied the request.
Long periods of silence from the court also made the wait for justice difficult, Zoya said. ""The last four years, we were fearful,"" she explained. ""We were worried maybe nothing’s going to come out of this.""
While the family is grateful for the judgment they received, Guila says they believe the settlement awarded through the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was ""a bit of an unfair decision"" and did not ""take into account the pain and the suffering of the family.""

Still, the landmark judgment paves the way for others to find justice, the family says. ""We’re hoping, with this administration, to use the judgment that we have and the work that we’ve been doing in the [Amer] Foundation to continue the accountability efforts,"" Guila said. ""A lot of other Lebanese citizens [and] American citizens that have been targeted by the Lebanese government, by Hezbollah in Lebanon, can now use this case to get justice for what happened to them,"" Zoya explained.
The sisters said the next steps in their journey are to find justice for their father and will involve requesting the State Department to sanction ""officials in Lebanon who were traitors and working with Hezbollah and Iran.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/who-could-next-pope","The College of Cardinals meet to elect the next pope. Who will it be?","'America's Newsroom' co-anchor Bill Hemmer discusses the life and legacy of Pope Francis.
There is no formal candidate process for the College of Cardinals to pull from when selecting the next pope – meaning any Catholic male could potentially be chosen as the next leader of the Catholic Church.
For the last 647 years, the College of Cardinals – which is the holy body that elects each pope – has pulled from within its own ranks to choose each successor to the papacy, and it is widely believed it will do so again when the conclave meets on Wednesday.
Reports suggest that there is still no clue who will succeed Pope Francis, though there are a few men expected to be at the top of the 135-member electoral body.
In this photo from files taken on April 18, 2005 and released by the Vatican paper L'Osservatore Romano, Cardinals walk in procession to the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, at the beginning of the conclave. (Osservatore Romano via AP)
PAPAL PULSE: EVERYDAY CATHOLICS REVEAL THEIR HOPES FOR THE NEXT POPE
Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, is the highest-ranking diplomat in the Holy See – which is the governing body of the Catholic Church – and is believed to be among the cardinals most likely to be elected to the top position.
His favor among cardinals in the Sacred College, who will vote on the next pope, is due to his politically moderate position and his career in diplomacy, reported The New York Post.
Parolin, who spent part of his career in Mexico and Nicaragua, was appointed by Pope Francis in 2014 and would likely be seen as an extension of the current papacy.

WILL THE NEXT POPE BE FROM ASIA?
Tagle is also believed to be a frontrunner among voting cardinals and serves as the pro-prefect for the section of first evangelization of the Dicastery for Evangelization, as well as president of the Interdicasterial Commission for Consecrated Religious.
He has been dubbed the ""Asian Pope Francis"" particularly for their similarities when it comes to their more embracing position of the LGBTQI community than their predecessors.
In a 2015 interview, Tagle said the Church’s ""severe"" position on the LGBTQI community, divorcees and single mothers was doing it harm.
According to the Catholic Herald, Tagle ""would be hailed by liberals, given the changing demographic of the Church.""

US CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS SUES TRUMP OVER IMMIGRATION, REFUGEE FUNDING FREEZE
There are several conservative cardinals who are believed to be top contenders for the papacy, including Cardinal Peter Erdo, who has been critical of Francis’ position on divorce and immigration.
Erdo has argued that divorced or re-married Catholics should not be allowed to receive Holy Communion due to his position regarding the ""indissolubility of marriage.""
The Catholic Herald pointed out that appointing a conservative pope following Francis’ tenure would ""send a powerful message about the direction the Church would be taking.""
Erdo has also differed from Francis greatly on immigration and argued in 2015 that permitting refugees to resettle is tantamount to human trafficking.

FROM THE HOLY LAND TO THE HOLY SEE: CARDINAL PIZZABALLA EMERGES AS PAPAL CANDIDATE
Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, offered himself up as a hostage in exchange for the release of the Israeli children brutally abducted by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023.
Though Hamas did not accept the exchange, the offer garnered international attention and brought his name forward as a potential future leader of the Catholic Church.
Should the Italian cardinal be chosen for the papacy, it would be the first time in 50 years that an Italian headed the Catholic Church, which was previously long seen as under Italian control – though, given the decades he has spent in the Middle East he is also seen as a Vatican outsider.

The Cardinal, often referred to as one of his baptismal names Tolentino, was made prefect of the Vatican’s Dicastery for Culture and Education in 2022.
Tolentino is among the youngest of the men flagged as a potential successor to Pope Francis, which could hinder his chances of landing the papal seat.
He was also closely aligned with Francis on several issues which has garnered some controversy, particularly when it comes to the church’s position on same-sex relationships.
The Portuguese cardinal is also viewed as liberal leaning given his push for the church to engage with modern culture, including in his support of a feminist Benedictine sister who favors women’s ordination and is pro-choice.

VATICAN PREPARES FOR LARGEST CONCLAVE IN HISTORY TO ELECT NEW POPE
Another conservative cardinal thought to be a serious contender is Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu from the war-torn nation of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Membership of the Catholic Church in Africa is growing faster than anywhere else in the world, according to the Associated Press.
The 65-year-old Ambongo controversially rejected Pope Francis' blessing of same-sex couples by the Catholic Church. In a letter signed by other African priests, they said they refused to follow the pontiff’s declaration because such unions are ""contrary to the will of God.""

The Wisconsin native and former archbishop of St. Louis is considered to be the leading American candidate. The 76-year-old cardinal is also viewed as being from the conservative side of the Church.
He is a proponent of the Latin Mass, and has been critical of Pope Francis regarding the Church’s new language around artificial contraception, LGBT issues and civil marriages. Burke was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.

Zuppi was born in Rome. He is the president of the Italian Episcopal Conference and is viewed as an insider in Francis’ Vatican, having served as the archbishop of Bologna.
The 69-year-old Zuppi is seen as being one of Pope Francis' favorites. He was sent on a peace mission in 2023 to Ukraine, where he met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He was also sent to meet with President Joe Biden that same year.
Zuppi was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2019.

Arborelius is the first Swedish cardinal in history and has become one of the favorites slated as one of the emerging front-runners to lead the Catholic Church.
As Sweden is a predominately Protestant nation with Catholics making up just over 1% of the country, Arborelius’ elevation from Bishop to Cardinal by Pope Francis in 2017, is still seen as an advantage when it comes to vying for the top spot.
He was also the first Swede to be made a bishop of Stockholm since the 1517 Protestant Reformation when St. John Paul II appointed him in 1998, reported the Catholic Review.

Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline is seen as a top contender for those who are looking to see core principles of Pope Francis carried on by the next pope, particularly when it comes to social justice and immigration.
Aveline also embraced Francis’ push to make the Catholic Church more welcoming.
As a native of Marseille, he is familiar with arguments for and against migration and he has worked with ethnically diverse populations in a city often seen as the crossroads between Africa and Europe, reported the National Catholic Reporter.

Of the 252 cardinals in the Sacred College, only 135 are under the age of 80 and therefore are permitted to participate in the conclave, the papal election process – though there are no age limitations for the candidate who would serve as the future pope.
Following the death of a pope, the conclave then holds a vote, and will continue to vote, until a pope is chosen by a two-thirds majority.
At that time, the ballots will be burned with a chemical that produces white smoke from the Sistine Chapel, as opposed to black smoke, to alert the world that a new pope has been chosen.

Cardinals entered St. Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday for a final Mass before the conclave to elect the successor to Pope Francis after his death last month.
The Mass comes before the private process to select a new leader of the Catholic Church.
The dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, prayed that the 133 cardinals find wisdom, good counsel and understanding before entering the Sistine Chapel to begin making their choices for the next pope.

The cardinals from 70 countries will be isolated from the outside world, with their cellphones surrendered and airwaves around the Vatican jammed to prevent all communications until a new pontiff is elected.
Francis named 108 of the 133 cardinals, selecting many pastors in his image from countries like Mongolia, Sweden and Tonga that had never had a cardinal before.

Many had not met one another until last week and explained that they needed more time to get to know one another, leading to questions about how long it could take for one of them to secure the two-thirds majority needed to become the 267th pope.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/india-launches-strikes-terrorist-camps-pakistan","India launches strikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan","Pakistan’s ambassador to the U.S. says his country has not seen a ""shred of evidence"" to suggest they were behind the Kashmir tourist attacks and called on President Donald Trump to step in and help alleviate worsening tensions with India.
India said it attacked ""terrorist infrastructure"" in neighboring Pakistan on Wednesday in two of its occupied territories, killing at least one child and wounding two other people in what Pakistan has called a ""blatant act of war.""
The Indian armed forces launched ""Operation Sindoor,"" which targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed, the Press Information Bureau of India said in a statement.
""Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature,"" India’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. ""No Pakistan military facilities have been targeted.""

""India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution,"" the statement said.
The missiles launched Wednesday struck locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in the country's eastern Punjab province. A mosque in the city of Bahawalpur was struck, killing a child, and a woman and man were injured, one Pakistani security official said.
The attack occurred in a remote valley only accessible on foot or by horse, and survivors claimed after the attack that the gunmen had accused some of the victims of supporting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
""In an unprovoked and blatant act of war, the Indian Air Force, while remaining within Indian airspace, has violated Pakistan’s sovereignty using standoff weapons, targeting civilian population across international border in Muridke and Bahawalpur, and across Line of Control in Kotli and Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir,"" a spokesperson for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said. ""India’s act of aggression has resulted in martyrdom of civilians, including women and children. This act of aggression has also caused grave threat to commercial air traffic.""

President Donald Trump said he hoped the tension between the two nations subsides.
""It's a shame. We just heard about it just as we were walking in the doors of the Oval (Office),"" he said. ""I just heard about it. I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They've been fighting for a long time. You know, they've been fighting for many, many decades and centuries, actually, if you really think about it.""

""I just hope it ends very quickly,"" he said.
The military action comes amid tense relations between the nuclear-armed states following an April 22 attack that killed 26 people in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir, a long-disputed territory that has been the source of tension between the two nations and is one of the most militarized regions in the world.
Kashmir has been a disputed region since both India and Pakistan gained their autonomy from Britain in 1947.
India has blamed Pakistan for backing the militant attack, which Islamabad has denied.
""In the wake of Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardizing regional peace and security,"" Pakistan said. ""India’s reckless action has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict.""
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was monitoring the situation.
""I am monitoring the situation between India and Pakistan closely,"" he wrote on social media. ""I echo @POTUS's comments earlier today that this hopefully ends quickly and will continue to engage both Indian and Pakistani leadership towards a peaceful resolution.""
Pakistani army spokesman, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, told ARY News that the missiles were launched Wednesday from within Indian territory and that no Indian aircraft had entered Pakistani airspace.

Adraee did not say whether Israel was planning on striking the international airport in the Houthi-controlled capital, but the warning came one day after Israel hit Houthi targets in Yemen in response to strikes fired by the terrorist group one day prior.
On Sunday, the Iran-backed Houthis launched a missile that landed near Israel’s largest airport in Tel Aviv in an apparent response to Israel’s newly announced expanded military operations in the Gaza Strip.

The Houthis accused the U.S. of carrying out joint strikes with Israel on Monday which killed four people and injured 39, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The U.S. has reportedly denied involvement in the joint strike.
The U.S. has ramped up its aerial and naval strikes against the Houthis, and since Operation Rough Rider commenced in mid-March, some 800 Houthi targets have been hit, according to an April 27 statement by U.S. Central Command.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/german-conservatives-bid-chancellor-falls-short-first-more-than-75-years","German conservative leader elected chancellor after historic first-round loss","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Friedrich Merz was elected chancellor of Germany after facing a historic loss in the Bundestag. In the second round, 325 lawmakers voted for Merz, bringing him past the 316-vote threshold. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has already demanded that Merz step down and call for new elections following his loss in the first round.
Merz’s initial loss marked a historic moment, as it was the first of its kind in post-war Germany.
The result came as a major upset, as Merz was widely expected to win, thanks to a coalition deal involving his party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU); its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU); and the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

TRUMP CELEBRATES CONSERVATIVE PARTY WIN IN GERMANY
In February, Merz led his party to a federal election victory and later signed the deal that many assumed would secure him the votes needed to become chancellor. However, on Tuesday, Merz received 310 votes—falling short by six—as at least 18 Members of the German Parliament in the coalition did not back him, according to Reuters.

GERMANY'S NEW LEADER LOOKS TO DISTANCE EUROPE FROM TRUMP
To secure the position of chancellor, Merz would have needed to win 316 out of 630 in the Bundestag. The coalition of CSU/CDU and SPD has 328 seats, more than enough to secure a majority victory. However, Merz received 310 votes, while 307 members voted against him and nine others abstained.

Despite his unexpected loss, Merz is not out of luck. The Bundestag now has 14 days to elect the next chancellor, and Merz still has a chance of winning the position. Germany’s socialist Left Party, however, is pushing to hold another round of chancellor elections as soon as Wednesday, according to Germany-based news outlet DW.
Merz had already lined up victory trips to France and Poland on Wednesday, Reuters reported, though it is unclear whether he will proceed with the visits as planned following the defeat.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-minister-says-gaza-entirely-destroyed-palestinians-forced-other-countries","Israeli minister says Gaza will be 'entirely destroyed,' Palestinians forced into other countries","Former advisor for Israel's UN mission Daniel Flesch joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the significance of Israel's plan to take Gaza and how the world is reacting to the proposal as President Donald Trump is expected to visit the Middle East.
A right-wing Israeli minister says victory for Israel won't come until Gaza is ""entirely destroyed"" and Palestinians are forced out into other countries.
Israeli Finance Minister Bazalel Smotrich made the statement during a Tuesday appearance at a conference on Jewish settlements in the West Bank. While Smotrich is a senior Israeli official, his statement does not represent the official policy of the Israeli government.
""Within a year we will be able to declare victory in Gaza,"" he told attendees. ""Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to... the south to a humanitarian zone without Hamas or terrorism, and from there they will start to leave in great numbers to third countries,"" Smotrich said, according to the Agence France-Presse.
""Israel does not intend to withdraw from territories the IDF captures, not even as part of a deal to release hostages,"" he added.

Smotrich's comments come just a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government approved a plan to take over Gaza and hold it for an undefined period on Monday.
Netanyahu said in a video message the operation would be ""intensive"" and would see more Palestinians moved to southern Gaza ""for their own safety.""
Israeli Cabinet ministers approved the plan Monday morning, but it will only take effect if a hostage deal is not reached by the time President Donald Trump visits Israel on May 13.

Israel currently controls roughly 50% of Gaza, and the plan would see Israeli forces expand into the south. Officials said the plan is set to be implemented gradually, with Israeli forces rooting out Hamas control over territories.

Dubbed Operation Gideon's Chariots, the plan would also seek to prevent the militant Hamas group from distributing humanitarian aid, which Israel says strengthens the group’s rule in Gaza. It also accuses Hamas of keeping the aid for itself to bolster its capabilities. The plan also included powerful strikes against Hamas targets, the officials said.

Israel’s controversial National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir recently visited the U.S., where he met with Jewish groups, law enforcement officials and politicians, as well as facing several clashes with protesters.
The shouting critics, however, did not appear to bother Ben-Gvir, who was a right-wing activist in his youth.
Ben-Gvir spoke with Fox News Digital about his U.S. visit, highlighting his trips to Mar-a-Lago, Yale and New York. He noted that he felt a shift in Israel-U.S. relations since President Donald Trump's return to the White House.
""Under Biden’s administration, I was considered persona non grata. Under Trump, I was welcomed at Mar-a-Lago and was able to speak,"" Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital. He added that having ""an American president who supports us and stands behind us makes a difference"" in wartime.

ISRAELI PRESIDENT SAYS NO PLANS TO EXPEL PALESTINIANS FROM GAZA AFTER MINISTERS' COMMENTS CAUSE UPROAR
Trump was not the only politician who met with the Israeli firebrand. Several high-profile Republicans, including Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., Michael Lawler, R-N.Y., and Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., met with Ben-Gvir on Capitol Hill.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee, which Mast chairs, posted a photo of the chairman with Ben-Gvir and wrote that the two discussed America and Israel’s shared security interests. Mast is well versed in both American and Israeli security needs as a U.S. Army veteran and former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) volunteer.
Prior to his meeting with Mast, Ben-Gvir had the chance to visit his home state where he saw something that he wanted to take back with him to Israel: gun culture.
Ben-Gvir has long been an advocate for wider distribution of firearms in Israel, and while he was visiting the U.S., he took time to see how America handles guns. He had the opportunity to visit both a shooting range and a gun store, which he said was ""fascinating.""

JEWISH YALE STUDENTS SPEAK OUT AFTER ANTISEMITIC PROTEST
""I was surprised by the quantity and types of weapons available. Even I haven’t reached that level,"" Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital.
He spoke about how critics have accused him of arming militias, which he denies. When speaking with Fox News Digital, Ben-Gvir said that the weapons he distributed in Israel ""saved many lives.""
""I believe we need to learn a from the Americans. One of the important lessons is their policy on weapons,"" Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital. ""I’m not sure I would distribute arms to the same extent, but I definitely believe in expanding access because citizens have the right to defend themselves.""
Gun culture in Israel has changed since the Oct. 7 massacre. Before the attacks, Israel was strict about who was eligible to obtain a firearm. Pre-Oct. 7, firearm licenses were restricted to those who live and work in high-risk areas, licensed tour guides and those who served with Israeli police or IDF security forces, among a few other specified categories, according to an Israeli government website from 2019.

Since Oct. 7, Israel has seen a rise in applications for firearm permits. While Ben-Gvir worked to streamline the handgun application process prior to the attacks, he instituted additional reforms after the massacre. According to the Times of Israel, these reforms included changes to military service requirements for those seeking a license. Additionally, he expanded eligibility requirements to include national service members who have no criminal record, history of violence or mental health issues.
""We need to allow as many citizens as possible to be armed. It gives people a sense of security—when someone has a weapon in their pocket, they feel safer,"" Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital.He added that he had been fighting to arm communities near Gaza but said people ""didn’t listen to me. After Oct. 7, I was proven right. It became clear how necessary it was to provide more weapons to civil defense squads.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/canadian-pm-carney-meet-trump-white-house-after-election-influenced-annexation-threats","Canadian PM Carney to meet Trump at White House after election influenced by annexation threats","Canada's Mark Carney reacted to winning election as prime minister Monday. (Reuters)
OTTAWA – While President Donald Trump was widely viewed as the major factor in securing a fourth consecutive term in office for the Liberals in last Monday’s Canadian general election, the Conservative leader played a role in his party’s defeat at the polls, according to Canadian political analysts.
""Trump set the stage"" for Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney ""as a somber leader for the Liberals, who made people feel assured that things could be handled when there was a sense of fear of people at the beginning of the campaign worried about"" the president’s threats of annexing Canada as the 51st state, University of Manitoba political studies professor Christopher Adams told Fox News Digital.
""It’s highly unusual for American presidents to wade into Canadian politics, especially during elections,"" said Adams.
He explained the last time that happened was during the 1963 Canadian general election campaign, when the press reported on President John F. Kennedy speaking favorably about Canadian Liberal Leader Lester Pearson, whose party toppled Prime Minister John Diefenbaker’s Progressive Conservatives to win the election and form a minority government.
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER MARK CARNEY SAYS 'OLD RELATIONSHIP' WITH US 'IS OVER' AMID TENSION OVER TRUMP TARIFFS

Trump directly inserted himself into Canada’s election day, April 28, as a quasi-candidate when he posted on social media that the ""Great people of Canada"" should ""elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World…if Canada becomes the cherished 51st. State of the United States of America.""
Whether in jest or not, the president’s pitch for annexation was a form of ""foreign interference,"" said Adams.
On NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, Trump said it was ""highly unlikely"" that the U.S. would use military force against Canada to acquire it as the 51st state.
The president will meet the Canadian prime minister for the first time at the White House on Tuesday.
After a post-election call with Carney last week, Trump said the Canadian leader ""couldn’t have been nicer"" and is ""a very nice gentleman.""
When asked about his upcoming meeting with the president, the prime minister told reporters at his first post-election news conference on Friday that Trump ""respects – as others who are good negotiators, and he’s one of the best negotiators – strength. That’s why we're building Canada strong.""
Before the Canadian election was called on March 23, the president told Fox News’ ""The Ingraham Angle"" host Laura Ingraham that he would ""rather deal with a Liberal than a Conservative,"" and said that Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is ""stupidly no friend of mine.""
Trump earlier told The Spectator that the Conservative leader’s ""biggest problem is he’s not a MAGA guy.""
""He’s not a Trump guy at all,"" said the president.
TRUMP’S THREATS AGAINST CANADA BOOST TRUDEAU'S LIBERAL PARTY IN THE POLLS AS NEW TARIFFS SET TO BEGIN

Carney’s Liberals won 169 out of 343 seats in the House of Commons to form a minority government in Canada’s 45th general election with 44% of the popular vote. The Conservatives placed second, with 41% of the popular vote, and 144 House seats.
More than 19.5 million Canadians cast their ballots in the election.
Poilievre lost his position as official opposition leader after being defeated in his Ottawa-area riding by Liberal Bruce Fanjoy. Carney, in his first run at seeking public elected office, handily won his Ottawa seat.
Poilievre will run in a yet-to-be-called byelection in an Alberta district in which the Conservative MP Damien Kurek, who was re-elected, will step aside.
At the beginning of the year, polls showed Poilievre was poised to become prime minister and lead his Conservatives to a majority government. He just did not pivot fast enough to a new reality that unfolded within Canada since then, according to Adams, who is writing a book about Canada’s public opinion-research industry.
Justin Trudeau, whose deep unpopularity as Liberal leader and prime minister, stepped down in March and was replaced by Carney, who scrapped an equally unpopular consumer carbon tax – two targets Poilievre continued to focus on.
""And Poilievre kept saying the country is broken, which was the last thing Canadians wanted to hear when Trump was making our country broken,"" said Adams, who added that the Conservative leader never polled high in likeability.
""Canadians didn’t realize how much they disliked him until Trudeau was gone.""

Poilievre will meet in Ottawa on Tuesday with members of the Conservative caucus who won their ridings in last week’s election. They could decide whether he stays or goes as leader through the Reform Act – a 10-year-old law introduced in Parliament by re-elected Conservative member of Parliament (MP) Michael Chong that empowers parliamentarians to hold leadership reviews following elections.
Conservative MPs will also need to choose an interim official opposition leader.
Adams believes Poilievre’s job as party leader is safe given the Conservatives’ overall electoral performance that led to them winning 16 more Commons seats in the most populous Canadian province of Ontario – at the expense of both the Liberals and fellow progressive New Democrats – and their forming the largest official opposition in Canadian history.
TRUMP THREATS BOOSTED CANADA’S CARNEY, HURT CONSERVATIVES AS COUNTRY VOTES FOR NEW LEADER
Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus in the University of Toronto’s Department of Political Science, told Fox News Digital that the race between the Liberals and Conservatives narrowed when Trump pulled back his attacks against Canada in the latter half of the campaign.
The focus shifted to ""Conservative issues – cost of living, affordability, housing, time for a change – while Carney was making speeches about Trump – because he knew that was his trump card, no pun intended – and it was wearing off,"" said Wiseman.

May will be a busy month for Carney. Next week, he will unveil his Cabinet and, on May 27, welcome King Charles III to read the Speech from the Throne to open the next session of Parliament as Canada’s head of state – the first time the British monarch has come to Ottawa to perform that ceremonial role since Queen Elizabeth II in 1977, 20 years after she did so during her first visit to Canada.
Wiseman said the royal visit is intended to showcase national unity in response to Trump’s threats against Canadian sovereignty.

However, the man who represented the crown as governor general in Canada from 1979 to 1984 said that he ""can’t believe that as many people are taking seriously this whole business of Trump talking about the annexation of Canada as an existential threat,"" Edward Schreyer, a former premier of his home province of Manitoba, told Fox News Digital. ""I think the whole thing is a joke – and was at the beginning, is now and ever shall be an absurdity.""

Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, discusses Republicans working on advancing President Donald Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill’ and Israel's response to a Houthi missile striking Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv.
The U.S. has reportedly launched a new round of airstrikes in Yemen after the Iran-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile that landed near Israel's main airport on Sunday.
The Houthi-controlled state news agency in Yemen reported that ""American aggression"" was behind several strikes on the capital, Sanaa, on Monday. At least 16 people were wounded, according to New Arab.
Since March 15, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) ""has conducted an intense and sustained campaign targeting the Houthi terrorist organization in Yemen to restore freedom of navigation and American deterrence,"" a U.S. Defense official told Fox News Digital on Monday. ""We will continue to increase the pressure and further disintegrate Houthi capabilities as long as they continue to impede freedom of navigation.""
Earlier Monday, Yemen’s Houthis vowed to continue attacks on Israeli airports after the missile briefly halted flights and commuter traffic at Israel’s main international airport near Tel Aviv. The Houthis issued a warning to airlines that they would carry out ""repeated targeting"" of Ben Gurion Airport, Israel’s main gateway to the world.
The Houthis had already threatened late Sunday to implement ""a comprehensive aerial blockade"" on Israel as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet was set to vote to expand fighting in Gaza.

Netanyahu said the U.S. was supporting Israeli operations against the Houthis. In a later statement, he added Israel would respond to the Houthis ""AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters.""
The U.S. military under President Donald Trump has been carrying out an intensified campaign of daily airstrikes targeting the Houthis since March 15.
USCENTCOM said in its most recent statement on April 27 that its forces have ""conducted an intense and sustained campaign targeting the Houthi terrorist organization in Yemen to restore freedom of navigation and American deterrence"" since March 15. ""These operations have been executed using detailed and comprehensive intelligence ensuring lethal effects against the Houthis while minimizing risk to civilians,"" USCENTCOM said.
USCENTCOM said the strikes ""have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapons storage locations.""
""While the Houthis have continued to attack our vessels, our operations have degraded the pace and effectiveness of their attacks. Ballistic missile launches have dropped by 69%. Additionally, attacks from one way attack drones have decreased by 55%,"" USCENTCOM added. ""U.S. strikes destroyed the ability of Ras Isa Port to accept fuel which will begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities.""

HOUTHI MISSILE STRIKES NEAR ISRAELI AIRPORT AFTER EVADING MISSILE DEFENSES
""Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Houthis. The Houthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime,"" USCENTCOM said. ""We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region.""
The Houthis have been firing at Israel since the war against Hamas in Gaza began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, raising their profile as the last member of Iran's self-described ""Axis of Resistance"" capable of launching regular attacks on Israel.
Their missiles have mostly been intercepted, although some have penetrated Israel's missile defense systems, causing damage.
The Israeli military said Sunday was the first time a missile struck the airport grounds since the Israel-Hamas war began. Initial findings indicated the likely cause was a technical issue with the interceptor, they said.

Multiple international airlines canceled or postponed flights. The war with Hamas in Gaza and then Hezbollah in Lebanon led a wave of airlines to suspend flights to Israel, but many have resumed in recent months.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/from-holy-land-holy-see-cardinal-pizzaballa-emerges-papal-candidate","From the Holy Land to the Holy See: Cardinal Pizzaballa emerges as papal candidate","EWTN News editorial director and Vice President Matthew Bunson discusses the conclave, challenges facing the next Pope and more on ‘Fox News Live.’
JERUSALEM – The Franciscan Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, who has served as the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem since 2020, has emerged as one of the top candidates to succeed the late Pope Francis.
The conclave will select the new Pope in Rome for the world’s more than 1 billion Catholics on Wednesday.
The Jesuit Pope Francis made Pizzaballa a cardinal in September 2023. The following month, Hamas terrorists invaded Israel, slaughtered more than 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage. Just a few weeks later, Pizzaballa declared he would offer himself as a hostage to the jihad terrorist movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of children kidnapped by the radical Islamists.
CONCLAVE TO PICK NEXT POPE TO BEGIN MAY 7, VATICAN SAYS

According to the Vatican News, Pizzaballa, the first cardinal to live in Jewish state, said, ""If I am ready for an exchange? Anything, if this can lead to freedom and bring those children back home, no problem. On my part, absolute willingness.""
Pizzaballa was born in northern Italy in 1965. He described his upbringing in the rustic environment of the Italian village of Castel Liteggio as delightful. ""Those were the last years of a simple country life, with the farmsteads already beginning to depopulate, but still living the last moments of a world now gone by.""

He added, ""The visits to the stables, where I was sent to fetch milk, the joy of riding in the horse-drawn carts to go make hay, the simple country games, and so on. It was a simple and genuine world, and a sober and happy life. Only with time did I realize how that world would influence me by giving me a style and pursuit of sobriety and sincerity.""
Israeli President Isaac Herzog has known Pizzaballa since the turn of the new century in 2000 and praised Pizzaballa’s ""fluid, eloquent Hebrew.""
Herzog previously said, ""He is a brilliant person.

However, Pizzabella caused a row with Israel’s government when he signed a statement urging Israel to ""avoid killing innocent people"" in its campaign to oust the U.S.-designated terrorist entity Hamas in Gaza.
From the Israeli perspective, the statement failed to blast Hamas’s massacre. Pizzaballa walked back his support for the statement and declared Hamas’s massacre as ""unacceptable and incomprehensible barbarity.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-says-trumps-middle-east-visit-window-opportunity-hostage-deal","Israel says Trump’s Middle East visit is the ‘window of opportunity’ for hostage deal","Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane weighs in on Israel announcing plans to take all of Gaza in wake of a Houthi missile attack near Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv.
A senior Israeli defense official on Monday said President Donald Trump's upcoming visit to the Middle East is the ""window of opportunity"" to secure a hostage deal, otherwise Israel will initiate a new military operation in the Gaza Strip.
""If there is no hostage deal, Operation 'Gideon Chariots' will begin with great intensity and will not stop until all its goals are achieved,"" the official said according to a Reuters report in reference to a Sunday night decision by Israel’s security cabinet to expand operations in the Gaza Strip.
Israel will use the roughly 10-day time frame to prepare for its new operations, which will entail calling up tens of thousands of reserve troops with the goal of taking over all the Gaza Strip.

In an apparent move to counter the terror group Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces will remain in captured territory rather than withdraw forces after an operation is complete. Israel has not presented a plan for how long it intends to occupy the Palestinian lands in a move that violated U.N.-brokered treaties and internationally recognized borders.
A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not respond to Fox News Digital’s questions.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that the plan approved by the cabinet to occupy territory and sustain Israel's presence in Gaza should be named the ""Smotrich-Netanyahu plan"" to ""give up on the hostages and Israel's security and national resilience.""
In the statement, the forum said that this plan is an admission by the government that it is choosing territories over freeing the hostages and noted that more than 70% of Israelis have opposed military prioritization over hostages in recent polling.
Trump had planned to make his trip to the Middle East, where he will visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates between May 13 and 16, his first international visit since re-entering the White House, to signify the significance of the region to the U.S.
While this will still be a major geopolitical visit, his first international trip ended up being his visit to Italy for Pope Francis’ funeral, where he held close discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Neither the White House nor the State Department immediately responded to Fox News Digital’s questions regarding Israel’s increasingly aggressive position and how it is impacting hostage and peace deal negotiations.

Comments made by Netanyahu last week sent ceasefire negotiators reeling after he, for the first time, confirmed that returning the hostages taken by Hamas nearly 580 days ago on Oct. 7, 2023 was not his top priority.
""We have many objectives, many goals in this war. We want to bring back all of our hostages,"" Netanyahu said. ""That is a very important goal. In war, there is a supreme objective. And that supreme objective is victory over our enemies. And that is what we will achieve.""
The Israeli prime minister also on Saturday justified his increasingly aggressive operations in Gaza that have resulted in the death of more than 50,000 in the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, including more than 15,600 children as of late-March, as ""a war between civilization and barbarism.""

Qatar, which has been heavily involved in hostage negotiations and ceasefire efforts, responded in a Saturday post on social media and said the comments ""fall short of the most basic standards of political and moral responsibility.""
""Portraying the ongoing aggression against Gaza as a defense of ‘civilization’ echoes the rhetoric of regimes throughout history that have used false narratives to justify crimes against innocent civilians,"" said Majed Al Ansari, advisor to Qatar Prime Minister Mohammad Al-Thani and spokesman for the foreign ministry.
Ansari did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s questions.

Dozens of witnesses reportedly looked on in horror as a U.S. tourist visiting Rome screamed in pain after impaling himself on a metal fence at the Colosseum.
The man — a 47-year-old American citizen living in Taiwan — was stabbed in the spine while attempting to climb over the historic monument's fence. He was possibly attempting to get a better view, according to Italian newspaper Il Messaggero.

Bystanders who saw the horrific event called for help as the tourist, stuck on the fence, screamed until he lost consciousness. Law enforcement and paramedics quickly arrived at the scene, but it took them more than 20 minutes to remove him from the fence, Il Messaggero reported.

The Vatican confirmed that Pope Francis’ ""pope-mobile"" – a vehicle outfitted to protect the pontiff during his 2014 trip to the birthplace of Jesus Christ – is being converted into a mobile children's clinic in Gaza according to the Holy Father’s dying wish.
The Catholic non-profit organization Caritas Jerusalem made the announcement on Sunday.
In a press release, the non-profit said that Francis directed the humanitarian organization in his final months to ""turn his pope-mobile into a mobile health station for the children in Gaza.""
""The purpose of the initiative is to safeguard and uphold children’s fundamental rights and dignity,"" Caritas Jerusalem wrote, releasing the first photos of the converted pope-mobile.

Peter Brune, Secretary General of Caritas Sweden, which is supporting the initiative, said the vehicle ""will be able to reach children who today have no access to healthcare – children who are injured and malnourished.""
""This is concrete, life-saving intervention at a time when the health system in Gaza has almost completely collapsed,"" Brune said in a statement. ""It’s not just a vehicle, it’s a message that the world has not forgotten about the children in Gaza.""
""The vehicle represents the love, care and closeness shown by His Holiness for the most vulnerable, which he expressed throughout the crisis,"" Secretary General of Caritas Jerusalem Anton Asfar said in a statement.
Swedish Cardinal Anders Arborelius – a contender to become the next pope after Francis' passing on April 21 – also confirmed the repurposing of the pope-mobile to the New York Times.
""The papamobile is a very concrete sign that Pope Francis is concerned with all the suffering of children in Gaza, even after his death!"" Arborelius wrote to the Times.
The same Catholic charity network handling the ""pope-mobile"" project notably slammed the Trump administration's cuts to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in February.
""Stopping USAID abruptly will kill millions of people and condemn hundreds of millions more to lives of dehumanizing poverty,"" Caritas Internationalis Secretary General Alistair Dutton said at the time. ""This is an inhumane affront to people’s God-given human dignity, that will cause immense suffering. Killing USAID also presents massive challenges for all of us in the global humanitarian community, who will have to completely reassess whom we can continue to serve and how.""
The State Department has integrated the remaining functions of USAID, as the department undergoes a massive restructuring.

TRUMP JOKES THAT HE'D LIKE TO BE POPE, 'NUMBER 1 CHOICE' — THEN NAMES A REAL CONTENDER
Francis approved the ""pope-mobile"" project in November 2024, the Times reported. The Catholic Church was gifted a new, all-electric ""pope-mobile,"" based on the Mercedes-Benz G-Class, an SUV, in December, according to USA Today.
Vatican News, the official news source of the Vatican, also picked up the announcement. The vehicle will be staffed ""by a driver and medical doctors"" and is currently being fitted with equipment for diagnosis, examination and treatment, including rapid tests for infections, suture kits, syringes and needles, oxygen supply, vaccines and a refrigerator for medicines, according to the non-profit.
""The humanitarian situation in Gaza is increasingly critical, especially for the nearly one million displaced children,"" Caritas Jerusalem wrote. ""When access to food, water and healthcare is cut off, children are often the first and hardest hit. Starvation, infection and other preventable conditions put their lives at risk.""
Before his passing, Francis ""made his pope-mobile available to Caritas Jerusalem, which is now turning it into a mobile health unit for children,"" according to the nonprofit. ""When the humanitarian corridor to Gaza reopens, it will be ready to give primary healthcare to children in Gaza.""
Francis had repeatedly called for a cease-fire in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war, which began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and took hundreds more into Gaza as hostages.

""I express my closeness to the sufferings ... of all the Israeli people and the Palestinian people,"" he said in a message read aloud by an aide, according to Reuters.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/battle-biblical-archaeology-intensifies-israeli-researchers-face-academic-boycott","Battle for biblical archaeology intensifies as Israeli researchers face academic boycott","Ze'ev Orenstein, the Director of International Affairs at the City of David Foundation in Jerusalem, discusses some of the most significant finds from the Holy Land. (Credit: Eliyahu Yanai/City of David Archive.)
TEL AVIV - A leading archaeology journal has effectively barred submissions by Israelis on Judea and Samaria unless they ""have cooperated with the relevant Palestinian authorities,"" in what analysts say is a microcosm of the harm caused by a global campaign to whitewash the Jewish people’s history in the Land of Israel.
According to a report recently published by The Press Service of Israel (TPS-IL), the Palestine Exploration Quarterly (PEQ)—a peer-reviewed journal of the London-based Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF)—is refusing to accept submissions from researchers affiliated with institutions operating in what it refers to as ""occupied territory,"" citing concerns over alleged Israeli violations of international law.
""Publication in PEQ is guided by the PEF’s ethical policy. The main aspect of this is international law, by which many academic institutions and publications, including PEQ, are bound,"" Charlotte Whiting, the journal’s editor-in-chief, told TPS-IL.
The journal’s website states that it ""does not collaborate with institutions founded by an occupying power based in any occupied territory, and will not support, encourage, fund, or publish research by any academic associated with such institutions.""
LEADING EVANGELICALS IN PUSH TO HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP RECOGNIZE ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER ‘BIBLICAL HEARTLAND’

Israeli archaeologists told TPS-IL that any cooperation with Palestinian authorities or colleagues was practically impossible, because they ""would be treated as traitors for this."" They also said that their work is in many instances shunned by the broader academic world and, as such, researchers are forgoing focus on the biblically significant areas of Judea and Samaria (West Bank) to protect their careers.
""What we’re seeing is a deliberate attempt to undermine Jewish historical ties to the land,"" Yishai Fleisher, international spokesman for Hebron, the cradle of Jewish civilization located in Judea, told Fox News Digital. ""There are three strategies at play: the Palestinians either acknowledge Jews were once here but argue they no longer belong, deny any Jewish connection at all, or destroy the evidence outright.""
Fleisher noted ongoing efforts by Palestinian authorities and others to rename historical Jewish sites. ""They call Hebron ‘Al-Khalil,’ and the Cave of the Patriarchs becomes the ‘Ibrahimi Mosque.’ The Temple Mount is now the ‘Al-Aqsa complex,’ and Rachel’s Tomb has been rebranded as the ‘Bilal Bin Rabah Mosque,’"" he said.
To counter this, he says Israeli advocates are working to mark and preserve ancient Jewish landmarks. ""We added an Israeli flag and a menorah to a building originally constructed by King Herod 2,000 years ago—which itself stands atop a tomb dating back 3,500 years—to make it unmistakably clear it’s a Jewish site, despite the later addition of three minarets by Muslim conquerors.""
The Palestinian Authority, which gained non-member observer state status at the United Nations in 2012, has been spearheading the campaign to rewrite history in global forums that contain automatic anti-Israel majorities.

Among them is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which in 2016 registered the Cave of the Patriarchs—the resting place of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah located in Hebron—in the name of the ""State of Palestine"" on its ""List of World Heritage in Danger."" More recently, UNESCO, in September 2023, named the Tell es-Sultan site near Jericho, which contains ruins dating back to the ninth millennium BCE, including evidence of one of humanity’s first-known villages, as a ""World Heritage Site in Palestine.""
In December 2021, the United Nations General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution referring to the Temple Mount, Judaism’s holiest site—located in Jerusalem but beyond the 1967 borders—only by its Muslim name, ""Haram al-Sharif."" In September 2024, P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas called the Temple Mount the ""exclusive property of Muslims."" Last week, Abbas said in a rare televised speech that the Koran describes the Jewish Temple as being in Yemen.
GOP LAWMAKERS PUSH TRUMP TO RECOGNIZE WEST BANK AS ISRAELI TERRITORY
Naomi Kahn, director of the international division at Regavim, a think tank focused on Israeli sovereignty, said the P.A. is actively building over key archaeological sites as part of this initiative.
""In Solomon’s Pools, which is under P.A. jurisdiction in accordance with the Oslo Accords, they’re constructing condominiums directly on top of ancient Jewish infrastructure,"" Kahn told Fox News Digital. ""These are internationally recognized heritage sites, but the agreements are being violated.
She cited the Hasmonean fortresses near Jericho as a major example. ""The burial grounds of Hasmonean kings—the largest necropolis in the Middle East from the Second Temple period—have been plowed and used for farming and construction. In one case, we found human bones scattered in the fields. The Israeli Civil Administration had to collect and rebury them.""
Khan also referenced Sebastia, the Greco-Roman name for the ancient city of Samaria. Originally founded by King Omri in the 9th century BC, Samaria became the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel, as noted in the Hebrew Bible (1 Kings 16:24). It served as the kingdom’s capital until it fell to the Assyrians in 722 BCE. Centuries later, Herod the Great rebuilt the city and renamed it Sebaste—Sebastia in later usage—in honor of the Roman Emperor Augustus, whose name in Greek, ""Sebastos,"" carried the same imperial meaning.
In March of last year, Palestinian construction workers built an illegal road through Sebastia, which is located near the city of Nablus, also known by its biblical name, Shechem.

Khan said other sites facing encroachment include Joshua’s Altar, where a new Palestinian neighborhood is being developed nearby, and Joseph’s Tomb, which is largely inaccessible to Jewish Israelis
""I’m disgusted, but not concerned,"" Sandra Hagee Parker, Chairwoman of the Christians United for Israel Action Fund, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""Where are the Romans, Ottomans, and Crusaders? The enemies of Israel are remembered only for their ultimate defeat by the God of Abraham and His children.
""Moreover, the grotesque effort to deny the Jewish connection to the Land is a rejection of God Himself,"" she continued. ""It is both antisemitic and anti-Christian—and it will never succeed. My only concern is that America continues to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel and her people,"" she added.
Ze'ev Orenstein, Director of International Affairs at the Jerusalem-based City of David Foundation, stressed that ""from its inception in 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization—the forerunner of today’s Palestinian Authority—was founded on the denial of thousands of years of Jewish history and heritage rooted in the Land of Israel in general, and in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria—the Biblical heartland—in particular.
""This denial,"" Orenstein told Fox News Digital, ""aimed to delegitimize and undermine the Jewish people's legal, moral and historical right to sovereignty in the Land of Israel, portraying a people with some of the deepest archaeological ties to the land as occupiers and colonizers.
""For that reason, the Islamic Waqf carried out a campaign of systematic destruction of antiquities atop the Temple Mount in the late 1990s, and Palestinian leadership continues to deny, damage, and destroy Jewish heritage sites throughout Judea and Samaria,"" he said.
Following the destruction and severe damage by Palestinian rioters at the 'Joshua Altar' archeological site located on the spur of Mt. Ebal, dozens of Jewish worshipers arrived for morning prayers at the site. (TPS)
In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July 2023 announced a $33 million program to safeguard and rehabilitate archaeological sites in the biblical heartland.
""In every corner of Judea and Samaria, one need only to put spade to ground in order to uncover archaeological finds that attest to our deep roots in the Land of Israel,"" Netanyahu said at the time. ""This plan will encourage tourism, education and [present] information for these important sites that tell the story of our people in Judea and Samaria.""
Rev. Dr. Petra Heldt, professor at the Jerusalem University College and director of the Ecumenical Theological Research Fraternity in Israel, cited biblical texts and ongoing excavations as proof of longstanding Jewish presence in the region.
""There are hundreds of biblical place names showing Jews lived in Judea and Samaria since the time of Abraham,"" Heldt told Fox News Digital. ""The Palestinian Authority has tried to erase this evidence, but it’s nearly impossible to eliminate.""
Heldt pointed to Shiloh as a thriving example, with an active kibbutz and archaeological site where new discoveries are regularly unearthed. ""Jewish communities are not only living in their ancestral homeland—they’re documenting it. You can see the impact of various layers of occupation over the last hundred years.""

According to Heldt, whose organization hosts global lectures and educational programs on archaeological findings in Judea and Samaria, more international support is needed to protect these sites. ""We must involve the media, universities, artists, filmmakers and writers to tell these stories and make these places matter globally,"" she said.
The struggle to preserve Jewish historical sites in Judea and Samaria is not just about stones or ruins—it’s a battle over narrative, legitimacy and identity, according to the experts.
""The way to fight this is to build, to educate and to assert our sovereignty,"" Hebron’s Fleisher said. ""That’s how we strengthen our connection to the land and protect the truth of our history.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation for the attack Sunday and will participate in several defense meetings throughout the day. The missile reportedly evaded both Israeli and U.S. missile defenses, according to Israeli media.
""Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold,"" said Defense Minister Israel Katz.
Lufthansa, Swiss, and Air Europa were among the airlines to cancel flights to Israel, though they expect to resume service on Monday.

(Credit: Reuters, Pool via WANA)
FIRST ON FOX: The massive explosion that rocked Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port in the southern coastal town of Bandar Abbas has exposed the ""deep vulnerabilities"" of the Islamic Republic’s vital sectors as its concerns over internal unrest mount.
Iranian authorities this week have faced mounting accusations of negligence and an attempt to ""cover up"" death toll figures and the strong suspicion it was using a civilian port to import explosive materials for the military.
But what remains largely unknown is the extent of the damage, the economic impact and how it will directly affect Iranians already discontent with the Iranian regime.

""Rajaee Port is Iran's primary hub for maritime exports and imports, particularly for oil-based products,"" Saeed Ghasseminejad, a senior advisor on Iran and an expert on its economy with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.
Ghasseminejad explained that the southern port accounted for 52% of Tehran’s oil trade in terms of volume, 77% of its industrial metals and 85% of all container shipments, though he pointed out it is not Iran's only major port.

""At this stage, there is no credible damage assessment,"" Ghasseminejad added, noting all guesses at this point about the extent of the damage were speculation based on images of the damage to the containers and the administrative buildings in the port.
But he noted that ""if the damage proves to be extensive and severe, it could place the regime under significant economic and logistical pressure.""
Just two days after the explosion, Tehran claimed port operations had returned to normal. Iran says the explosion killed 70, but some sources estimate the toll could be closer to 250.
Drone footage of the port showed substantial damage, including the destruction of the nearby administrative buildings and a crater left by the explosion.

Officials with the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) also told Fox News Digital that eyewitnesses have suggested it could take up to 20 days to extinguish ongoing fires, some of which are believed to be in the shipping containers.
""A clearer picture should emerge in the coming weeks,"" Ghasseminejad said. ""It is unlikely that the port is back to its normal operation and full capacity given the damage to the administrative buildings, the infrastructure, and the fact that hundreds of people working at the port are unfortunately dead, missing or injured.
""The regime has the incentive to lie as it wants to show it has control over the situation, but a lot of sources inside Iran in the business community differ.""
The Iranian regime was accused of ""covering up"" the death toll this week by the NCRI, which has spoken to eyewitnesses at the port, in a move to counter internal dissidence. It also took steps to limit access to information for not only local residents but media outlets, and it downplayed the severity of the incident.

""Regardless of the final assessment, the explosion underscores the deep vulnerabilities in Iran’s critical infrastructure and the regime's incompetence,"" Ghasseminejad said, ""vulnerabilities that are even more acute in sectors vital to the regime’s survival, such as crude oil export terminals and gas production facilities.
""The regime is now both incompetent and weak, a deadly combination.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/next-pope-from-asia","Will the next pope be from Asia?","Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris reports from Rome ahead of next week's papal conclave.
KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — There may only be a few days before the College of Cardinals gathers inside the Sistine Chapel to elect the next leader of the Catholic Church, and, for the first time in history, an Asian pope is a real possibility.
Of the 23 cardinals from Asia eligible to vote, one name comes up again and again, that of Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, sometimes called the ""Philippine Francis.""
The 67-year-old had a close relationship with Pope Francis and served as his envoy to Asia during the 2015-16 special Jubilee Year, during which he made a brief stop in Taipei, Taiwan. Tagle also accompanied Francis on his first international trip to Asia in 2014, when the pontiff visited South Korea.

Pope Francis achieved several ""firsts"" in Asia, including becoming the first pontiff to visit Myanmar in 2017 and Mongolia in 2023. Thomas Tu, a Vatican diplomacy expert at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, told Fox News Digital that while Mongolia is home to only about 1,400 Catholics, it now hosts a cardinal, but he is Italian-born and just 50 years old, making his election as pope unlikely.
Another Asian candidate is Burma's Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, 76, from a country where Catholics represent just about 1% of the population. Meanwhile, over the last several days, reports from South Korean newspapers are suggesting South Korean Cardinal Lazarus You Heung-sik, 74, is among the leading candidates to succeed Pope Francis.

Catholicism is growing rapidly in South Korea, according to Taipei-based Tu, who told Fox News Digital both Buddhists and Protestants have been converting at surprising rates.
""Unlike in Brazil, where Catholics are losing members to Evangelicals, Korea’s Catholic Church is attracting new followers,"" Tu said. Then-Bishop Lazarus You Heung-sik is widely credited with helping persuade Pope Francis to make South Korea the first stop on his Asian travels in 2014. Heung-sik was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2022.

Francis may one day be rated as among the most influential popes of all time. Pope John Paul II made history by becoming the first pope from Poland and his pontificate lasted 26 years (1978-2006). Francis was head of the Catholic Church for a much shorter time, almost exactly 12 years, but the late pope appointed 80% of the cardinals who will vote for his successor.
The late Holy Father also enlarged the number of cardinals and, for the first time in history, the upcoming conclave will see European cardinals in the minority. However, some experts warn against assuming the next pope will be ""Francis the Second,"" as many of these new cardinals are considered more conservative.
CONCLAVE TO PICK NEXT POPE TO BEGIN MAY 7, VATICAN SAYS

The home nation of Asian cardinals doesn’t necessarily reflect the number of Catholics there. In Japan, Catholics make up fewer than 0.5% of the population, but there is a Japanese cardinal who is reasonably active on social media. The largest Asian block of cardinals hails from majority-Hindu India, which has six to the predominately Catholic Philippines’ five.
Still, many Vatican watchers believe Cardinal Tagle remains the most likely Asian candidate, although his progressive stances may prove divisive. Tagle has publicly criticized the church for using ""harsh words"" in past criticisms of LGBTQ Catholics and remarried divorcees and advocates for a more flexible approach. This stance is in line with Pope Francis’ 2015 papal declaration that said the church needs to ""avoid judgments which do not take into account the complexity of various situations.""

Should Tagle beat the odds and become the next pope, his election would energize the church’s progressive wing, as he would likely continue the liberal-leaning direction charted by Francis. His emphasis on serving the poor has won him admiration across Asia and beyond, as has his relatable style. Tagle reportedly prefers being called by his nickname ""Chito,"" rather than by his formal title.

Thomas Tu shared a personal story about Tagle’s compassion, recalling an incident before the cardinal received his red hat. After a young seminarian died suddenly, Tagle chose to join the group of senior seminary members and personally visit the grieving family, later giving a moving sermon in which he ""compared the church to a mother, similar to the one who had lost her son,"" Tu said. ""Tagle just has a way of reaching people that is special.""
Few dispute that the election of the next pope will be among the most consequential moments for the Catholic Church in decades. And, for the first time, candidates from Asia are now part of serious conversations about the future direction of the faith.

British counterterrorism officers arrested several Iranian men over an alleged plan to attack an undisclosed location in London, the London Metropolitan Police announced Sunday.
Five men between the ages of 29 and 46 were taken into custody on Saturday in various parts of England on suspicion of preparing a terrorist act.
Four of the men are Iranian citizens, while investigators are still working to determine the nationality of the fifth.
In a separate investigation, three other Iranian men, aged 39, 44 and 55, were arrested in London on suspicion of a national security offense.

All the suspects are being questioned at police stations but have not yet been charged. Police are searching several properties in London, Manchester in northwest England and Swindon in western England.
Police said the attack plot targeted a single location, which the agency said is not being revealed ""for operational reasons.""
Commander Dominic Murphy, who leads the police force’s Counter Terrorism Command, said investigators are still working to establish a motive ""as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public.""

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the arrests were ""serious events that demonstrate the ongoing requirement to adapt our response to national security threats.""
""The government continues to work with police and intelligence agencies to support all the action and security assessments that are needed to keep the country safe,"" she said.
In October, the head of Britain’s MI5 domestic security service, Ken McCallum, said his agents and police have identified 20 ""potentially lethal"" plots backed by Iran since 2022, with most targeting Iranians in the U.K. who oppose the country’s authorities.

McCallum said at the time there was the risk ""of an increase in, or broadening of, Iranian state aggression in the U.K."" if conflicts in the Middle East intensified.
The U.K.’s official terror threat level stands at ""substantial,"" which falls in the middle of a five-point scale, meaning an attack is likely.

A car crashed into the entrance of Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in the Philippines on Sunday, killing two people and injuring several others, according to officials.
A man and a young girl were killed and four others were injured in the crash that involved a black SUV. The Philippine Red Cross, which responded to the scene, said the girl was four-years-old, but Secretary of Transportation Vivencio Hizon said she was five-years-old.
NAIA said a ""vehicular accident"" happened on Sunday when the car crashed through the airport's outer railing and into the walkway near the entrance of Terminal 1.

""We understand the concern this incident has caused, especially as images have circulated on social media,"" the airport's operator, New NAIA Infra Co., said in a statement. ""We urge the public not to speculate and to wait for verified updates, which will be issued as soon as they become available.""
Initial reports indicate that the SUV was parked near the terminal entrance when the driver accidentally hit the gas instead of the brakes and accelerated after a car suddenly passed in front of him, according to local media.
People injured in the incident were receiving medical treatment. The driver of the vehicle involved in the crash was taken into custody by police, according to the airport's operator.

Images shared by local media showed some people lying on the ground. Shattered glass was seen across the terminal's entrance and the front of the black SUV was visibly damaged from striking the airport doors.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexican-president-declines-trumps-offer-us-troops-help-fight-drug-cartels","Mexican president declines Trump's offer of US troops to help fight drug cartels","Buck Wehrbein, NCBA President and rancher, sounds the alarm on the return of the screwworm and urges action from Mexico while crediting strong pressure from the Trump administration and Secretary Rollins for recent progress.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum publicly confirmed she rejected U.S. military assistance from President Donald Trump, who was looking to help the country fight drug trafficking and violent cartels.
Responding to a Wall Street Journal report Friday that detailed the offer, Sheinbaum confirmed ""it's true.""
Trump reportedly called Sheinbaum and asked, ""How can we help you fight drug trafficking?""
She told Trump the country will ""never accept"" the presence of the U.S. Army in its territory.
CONSERVATIVE GROUP’S ROADMAP SHOWS HOW TRUMP CAN USE MILITARY TO THWART CARTELS

""No, President Trump, our territory is inalienable, sovereignty is inalienable,"" Sheinbaum said. ""We can collaborate. We can work together, but with you in your territory and us in ours. We can share information, but we will never accept the presence of the United States Army on our territory.""
SINALOA CARTEL TAKES ROOT IN AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS: WHERE ARE THEY?
In a written statement to Fox News Digital Saturday, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly highlighted coordinated efforts with Mexico to address border security.
""President Trump has worked with President Sheinbaum to advance border security collaboration with Mexico to the highest levels ever,"" Kelly wrote. ""This robust cooperation and information sharing is delivering tangible results, including the removal of numerous cartel leaders to the U.S. to face justice and creating the most secure border in history.""
A group of attendees was in the crowd as Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke publicly about the exchange with President Donald Trump. (AP Images)
Since taking office, Trump has continued to use CIA drones to conduct surveillance flights over the country in coordination with the Mexican government.
He has also formally named drug cartels ""foreign terrorist"" groups.

However, Kelly said Mexico must do more to protect Americans from dangerous foreign terrorist organizations and ""the drugs and violence they flood into communities on both sides of the border.""
""We will continue exploring ways to enhance our efforts across the region to dismantle these transnational criminal organizations,"" she wrote. ""We will make America safe again.""
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the U.S. Army is not welcome in Mexico. (AP Images)
The Heritage Foundation, a top conservative group, released a report in January detailing how Trump could use the military to confront the border crisis.
It argued that Mexican cartels are continuing to grow, illegal immigration and narcotics smuggling have accelerated and U.S.-Mexico security cooperation has deteriorated.
However, the report noted direct military action against cartels should be a ""last resort,"" preferring joint military action with Mexican coordination, Fox News Digital previously reported.

""In the appropriate context, unilateral U.S. military action may be employed to disrupt cartel activity and prompt cooperation from a resistant Mexican government,"" the group wrote.
The foundation claimed Mexico was unlikely to change its stance when Sheinbaum was elected despite the escalating threat from cartels.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/australian-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-wins-second-3-year-term","Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wins a second 3-year term","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Anthony Albanese claimed victory as the first Australian prime minister to clinch a second consecutive term in 21 years on Saturday and suggested his government had increased its majority by not modeling itself on U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
""Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, looking after each other while building for the future,"" Albanese told supporters in a victory speech in Sydney.
DEBATE OVER USING BEACH CABANAS AT POPULAR TRAVEL DESTINATION PROMPTS PRIME MINISTER TO WEIGH IN
""We do not need to beg or borrow or copy from anywhere else. We do not seek our inspiration overseas. We find it right here in our values and in our people,"" he added.
His center-left Labor Party had branded Albanese's rival Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, ""DOGE-y Dutton"" and accused his conservative Liberal Party of mimicking Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency.
Dutton had earlier conceded his alliance of conservative parties had been defeated at the election and that he had lost his own parliamentary seat that he had held for 24 years.

Dutton's plight parallels that of Canada's opposition leader, Pierre Poilievre, who lost his seat after Trump declared economic war on the U.S. neighbor to the north. Poilievre had previously been regarded as a shoo-in to become Canada’s next prime minister and shepherd his Conservative Party back into power for the first time in a decade.
Analysts argue that mirroring Trump switched from a political positive for Australian conservatives to a negative after Trump imposed global tariffs.
Trumpet of Patriots, a minor party inspired by Trump policies with an advertising budget funded by mining magnate Clive Palmer that eclipsed the major parties, attracted only 2% of the vote.
Zareh Ghazarian, a lecturer in politics at Monash University, in Melbourne, questioned the significance of the ""DOGE-y Dutton"" lable in the election result.
""We won't know. But I'm not sure it had a massive impact,"" Ghazarian said. ""It is a huge win for Labor and it's a massive rebuke for the Liberal Party.""
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated Albanese on his election to a second three-year term.
""Australia is a valued ally, partner, and friend of the United States. Our shared values and democratic traditions provide the bedrock for an enduring alliance and for the deep ties between our peoples,' Rubio said in a statement.
""The United States looks forward to deepening its relationship with Australia to advance our common interests and promote freedom and stability in the Indo-Pacific and globally,"" he added.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a fellow center-left leader, congratulated Albanese on his victory.
""The U.K. and Australia are as close as ever – which goes to show that long-distance friendships can be the strongest,"" Starmer said. ""I know that we will continue to work together on our shared ambitions, including on trade, investment and energy, working towards a better life for working people in the U.K. and Australia.""
Labor held a narrow majority of 78 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives, the lower chamber where parties form governments.
Australian governments are usually elected for at least a second term, but are expected to lose seats at the second election. But Labor is on track to increase its majority in its second term.
Energy policy and inflation have been major issues in the campaign, with both sides agreeing the country faces a cost of living crisis.
The Liberal Party blamed government waste for fueling inflation and increasing interest rates, and has pledged to cut more than one in five public service jobs to reduce government spending.
While both said the country should reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, Dutton argues that relying on nuclear power instead of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind turbines would deliver less expensive electricity.
Labor argued Dutton’s administration would slash services to pay for its ambitions to build seven government-funded nuclear generators. Australia currently has no nuclear power.
Opposition senator Jacinta Nampijnpa Price would have been responsible for cutting 41,000 public service jobs in Dutton's administration. She attracted media attention last month when she told supporters her government would ""make Australia great again.""
Price told reporters at the time she didn’t recall using the words reminiscent of the Republicans’ ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.
Price, who said she was photographed wearing a MAGA cap ""in jest at Christmas time,"" on Saturday blamed the news media for focusing on Trump in the election campaign.
""You made it all about Donald Trump,"" Price told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""We really couldn’t care less about the way Donald Trump is governing for America. We were concerned with the way Australia is being governed under an Albanese government.""
The election took place against a backdrop of what both sides of politics describe as a cost of living crisis.

Foodbank Australia, the nation’s largest food relief charity, reported 3.4 million households in the country of 27 million people experienced food insecurity last year. That meant Australians were skipping meals, eating less or worrying about running out of food before they could afford to buy more.
The central bank reduced its benchmark cash interest rate by a quarter percentage point in February to 4.1% in an indication that the worst of the financial hardship had passed. The rate is widely expected to be cut again at the bank’s next board meeting on May 20, this time to encourage investment amid the international economic uncertainty generated by Trump’s tariff policies.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/rubio-blasts-communist-cuban-regime-nj-troopers-killer-remains-free","Rubio blasts communist Cuban regime as NJ trooper’s killer remains free","Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports on growing calls to bring American fugitives, including a convicted cop-killer, back from Cuba to face justice in the United States.
On Friday, May 2nd in 1973, New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster approached a car that had been pulled over by police for a broken taillight on the New Jersey Turnpike.
Inside were three armed members of the radical Black Liberation Army.
Gunfire erupted, and in the shoot-out, Officer Foerster was hit four times and killed. Now, decades later, the officer's cold-blooded execution is spurring new calls for justice.
One of the militants in the car, Joanne Chesimard, has lived a life on the lam. In 1979, she escaped from a New Jersey prison and, in the decades since, she has been living freely in Cuba.
""She should be serving a life sentence,"" says the current head of the state police, New Jersey State Police Superintendent Colonel Patrick J. Callahan

""I want her yesterday, and I have Trooper Foerster's handcuffs ready to go on her when she lands on that tarmac, wherever she is.""
There are new calls to extradite her and the estimated 70 fugitives from U.S. justice, including convicted murderers, airline hijackers and others who continue to enjoy safe haven in Cuba.
President Donald Trump has called on the Cuban regime to cough up Chesimard and the others.
""Return the fugitives from American justice, including the return of the cop-killer Joanne Chesimard,"" he declared in 2017.  Now the Trump administration is taking tougher measures against Cuba that could eventually result in the fugitives being back on U.S. soil. In January, the administration slapped new sanctions on the Cuban regime, and it is considering tougher actions.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is denouncing the Communist government's protection of American criminals.
""The Cuban regime continues to provide safe haven for terrorists and criminals, including fugitives from the United States,"" he said in a statement to Fox News.

""The brutal killing of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster will never be forgotten, and we will never stop fighting for justice.""
President Obama normalized relations with the Cuban government in 2015, and while a few fugitives have been returned, terrorists were not among them. In 2018, James R. Ray, a lawyer wanted for murder in Montclair, New Jersey, was extradited by Cuba back to the state. He was convicted and died in jail while awaiting sentencing in 2023.
In his first term, President Trump scrapped the Obama agreements, and he has since put Cuba back on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, which President Biden had removed.
""I understand it's a sovereign nation and that there's no extradition policy, but here's somebody who has murdered a New Jersey State Trooper who lives free, and that just is painful for law enforcement, not only in New Jersey, but across the country,"" says Colonel Callahan. ""Anything that I can do to bring her back to serve out the rest of her sentence is what I'm going to do.""

""It's disgusting that some killer like this would be just roaming the streets in Cuba,"" says Senator Rick Scott, R-Fla. ""It makes you mad. It makes you mad that Cuba harbors these terrorists and these fugitives.""
Scott is sponsoring a Senate bill, ""The Frank Connor and Trooper Werner Foerster Justice Act,"" demanding the fugitives' return. Rubio first introduced the legislation before he was named secretary of state.
Scott is calling for even stronger measures against the Communist nation.
""We have to make sure there's no money that goes there. They're clearly a state sponsor of terrorism,"" Scott says."" Trump did the right thing by putting them back on.""

The bill is also named for another victim, Frank Connor. In 1975, Connor, a New York City banker, was having lunch in the historic Fraunces Tavern when a bomb exploded, killing him and three others, and wounding more than 50 people. The device had been planted by the Puerto Rican terrorist group ""Armed Forces for National Liberation"" (FALN), which was responsible for a wave of terrorist bombings in New York City in the 1970s.
The FALN's chief bombmaker, Willie Morales, also escaped a U.S. prison to find safety in Fidel Castro's Cuba.
""We have convicted terrorists who we do have the power to get back,"" says Connor's son, Joe, who has been in the forefront of the push to return the fugitives. He says President Trump can achieve that.
""Trump absolutely can use economic power,"" he says. ""We have these convicted terrorists 90 miles from home, we have the economic leverage on Cuba to bring them back. Cut the deal, bring these guys back, and then we will talk about how we are going to assist Cuba in the future.""
Four people were killed, and more than 50 were injured, after a bomb exploded in Fraunces Tavern, in New York City. The FALN, a Puerto Rican nationalist group, claimed responsibility. (New York Daily News via Getty Images)
""It would really mean something, that there is justice for my dad.""
In January, Secretary of State Rubio honored Connor and the other Fraunces Tavern victims on the anniversary of the FALN attack.
""We must also recommit ourselves to demanding that wanted U.S. fugitives under the Cuban regime’s protection be brought to justice. We owe the victims and the American people our unwavering commitment to holding the Cuban regime accountable.""
New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy marked the anniversary of Foerster’s murder by saying, ""As we honor his memory, our commitment to justice has never wavered. More than half a century later, we continue to pursue his murderer’s repatriation to New Jersey to face the consequences of her actions.""

Colonel Callahan notes that in its 104-year history, the state police force has lost 78 troopers in the line of duty, but that Foerster’s death and Chesimard’s freedom remain ""an open wound.""
""There’s not a day that goes by that I’m not trying to do something about bringing her back here,"" he says.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/pro-gaza-candidates-elected-despite-gender-segregation-antisemitism-controversies","Pro-Gaza candidates elected despite gender segregation, antisemitism controversies","For the first time since Hamas seized power 18 years ago, Gazans are speaking out against Hamas at great personal risk, Fox News' Mike Tobin reports.
A small English town north of bustling Manchester just saw two controversial pro-Gaza candidates flip seats held by the mainstream Labour Party. Both candidates ran as independents in the May 1 local elections.
Maheen Kamran, 18, won the Burnley Central East seat on the Lancashire County Council, while Azhar Ali won the position of county councillor for the Nelson East ward. The Telegraph noted that their victories could be part of a growing trend, following a slew of pro-Gaza candidates—including former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn—winning seats in last year’s general election.
Ali is a former Labour Party member who was suspended from the party and lost its backing over allegations of antisemitism during an election last year. Labour initially supported Ali after he claimed that Israel ""allowed"" Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre to occur as a pretext to invade Gaza, according to the BBC. He later apologized for making what he called a ""deeply offensive, ignorant and false"" claim. Labour withdrew its support for Ali and later suspended him from the party.

ISRAEL DENIES ENTRY TO TWO BRITISH LAWMAKERS ACCUSED OF PLANNING TO 'SPREAD ANTI-ISRAEL HATRED'
The Board of Deputies of British Jews did not accept Ali’s apology, calling his comments ""disgraceful and unforgivable.""
""It is clear to us that Mr. Ali is not [apologizing] out of a genuine sense of remorse. Despite what he says in his apology, we do not see how we could possibly engage with him at this time, and we believe other leading Jewish communal groups will feel similarly,"" the organization wrote in a 2024 statement.

Meanwhile, Kamran has taken radical stances of her own. She voted in favor of ending the ""free mixing"" of Muslim men and women in public spaces.
""Muslim women aren’t really comfortable with being involved with Muslim men. I'm sure we can have segregated areas, segregated gyms, where Muslim women don't have to sacrifice their health,"" Kamran told PoliticsHome.

In the same interview, Kamran said she entered politics because she believes there is a ""genocide"" taking place in Gaza. While critics of Israel’s military actions use the term ""genocide,"" supporters of the Jewish state often argue that Israel has the capability to destroy Gaza’s population but has chosen not to, thereby disputing the genocide claim.
Ali and Kamran’s victories come as mainstream parties lose influence in local elections. The right-wing populist Reform UK Party saw major gains in the latest election, according to the Telegraph. Meanwhile, despite its control of 10 Downing Street, Labour suffered losses in the recent local elections.

(Video courtesy of AP, thumb courtesy of Reuters)
The Trump administration on Friday officially designated two of Haiti’s most powerful gang networks, Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif, foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) and specially designated global terrorists (SDGTs).
The move is aimed at disrupting the gangs' operations and supporting efforts to restore order in the troubled Caribbean nation.
The announcement was made in a formal statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who declared that ""the age of impunity for those supporting violence in Haiti is over.""
""These gangs have killed and continue attacking the people of Haiti, Haitian security forces and multinational security support (MSS) mission personnel and are committed to overthrowing the government of Haiti,"" Rubio said. ""Their ultimate goal is creating a gang-controlled state where illicit trafficking and other criminal activities operate freely and terrorize Haitian citizens.""

The designations bring serious legal consequences. Individuals or entities that provide material support to Viv Ansanm or Gran Grif could face criminal charges, loss of immigration benefits or removal from the U.S.
Viv Ansanm formed in September 2023 through an alliance between Haiti’s two main gang factions, G-9 and G-Pép. The coalition has carried out coordinated attacks on Haitian infrastructure, including prisons, government buildings and the Port-au-Prince international airport. These attacks were part of a broader campaign that helped force the resignation of former Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry.

Gran Grif operates mainly in the Artibonite region, a vital agricultural area. The State Department said the gang has been responsible for 80% of civilian death reports in that area since 2022. In February 2025, Gran Grif was linked to an attack that killed a Kenyan officer with the MSS mission.
According to NPR reporting from 2024, Viv Ansanm was spearheaded by Jimmy Chérizier, known as Barbecue, a former police officer turned gang leader.
Chérizier helped unify rival gangs under a shared goal of opposing the Haitian government. In an interview with NPR, he defended the gang’s actions and blamed Haiti’s political elite for fostering the lawlessness. Though he acknowledged the violence, he claimed the government had enabled the conditions leading to it.

""These designations play a critical role in our fight against these vicious groups and are an effective way to curtail support for their terrorist activities,"" Rubio said. He also warned that U.S. citizens and lawful residents who engage in transactions with these groups are exposing themselves to sanctions and prosecution.

Rubio praised the Haitian National Police and international partners for their efforts in pushing back against the gangs. ""We commend the extraordinary bravery of the Haitian National Police and all international partners supporting the MSS mission for their ongoing efforts to establish stability and security in Haiti,"" he said.
He called on Haitian political leaders to focus on restoring peace.
""We urge all of Haiti’s political leaders to prioritize the security of the Haitian people, find solutions to stop the violence and make progress toward the restoration of democracy through free and fair elections,"" Rubio said.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/intelligence-agency-classifies-countrys-popular-alternative-germany-party-extremist","Intelligence agency classifies country's popular Alternative for Germany party as 'extremist'","American Majority founder and CEO Ned Ryun joins 'FOX & Friends' to analyze the conservative party winning the chancellor's election in Germany.
Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution or BfV, on Friday classified the country’s popular Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as ""extremist.""
""Central to our assessment is the ethnically and ancestrally defined concept of the people that shapes the AfD, which devalues entire segments of the population in Germany and violates their human dignity,"" the BfV said, explaining its decision. ""This concept is reflected in the party’s overall anti-migrant and anti-Muslim stance.""
The AfD slammed the decision, calling it a ""blow against democracy,"" claiming it was ""clearly politically motivated,"" which the BfV denied.
The U.S. also criticized the designation, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio claiming it is ""tyranny in disguise.""
GERMANY ACCUSES ELON MUSK OF TRYING TO INTERFERE IN ITS NATIONAL ELECTIONS

""Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition,"" Rubio posted on X. ""That’s not democracy—it’s tyranny in disguise. What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD—which took second in the recent election—but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes. Germany should reverse course.""
Elon Musk wrote on X: ""Banning the centrist AfD, Germany's, most popular party, would be an extreme attack on democracy.""
AfD leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said, ""The AfD will continue to take legal action against these defamatory attacks that endanger democracy.""
Vice President JD Vance met with Weidel before the election and said that free speech was under attack in Europe.

The BfV also classifies the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party (NDP), the Islamic State and other Islamist groups, and the far-left Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany as ""extremist.""
The classification allows the intelligence agency to closely surveil the AfD, which came in second in Germany’s February elections, winning a record number of seats in parliament.
Germany’s intelligence agency is more legally constrained than other European countries in its ability to surveil political parties, which requires the ""extremist"" designation, because of its history under Nazi and Communist rule.
The designation also allows the intelligence service to intercept party communications.
The ""extremist"" designation followed a 1,100-page report by the intelligence agency, and a court case loss for AfD in challenging the BfV’s previous classification of the political party as one suspected of extremism.

CDU, along with its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), won Germany’s elections in February after garnering 28.6% of the vote, according to Germany’s international broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW).
The AfD secured 20.8% of the vote. Meanwhile, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) won just 16.4% of the vote, its worst result since World War II.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-readies-russia-sanctions-over-ukraine-unclear-trump-sign-sources-say","US readies Russia sanctions over Ukraine, unclear if Trump will sign, sources say","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
U.S. officials have finalized new economic sanctions against Russia, including banking and energy measures, to intensify pressure on Moscow to embrace U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to end its war on Ukraine, according to three U.S. officials and a source familiar with the issue.
The targets include state-owned Russian energy giant Gazprom and major entities involved in the natural resources and banking sectors, said an administration official, who like the other sources requested anonymity to discuss the issue.
US-UKRAINE INCHING TOWARD MINERAL DEAL AMID LAST-MINUTE ROADBLOCKS
The official provided no further details.
It was far from clear, however, whether the package will be approved by Trump, whose sympathy for Moscow's statements and actions have given way to frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spurning of his calls for a ceasefire and peace talks.
The U.S. National Security Council ""is trying to coordinate some set of more punitive actions against Russia,"" said the source familiar with the issue. ""This will have to be signed off by Trump.""
""It’s totally his call,"" confirmed a second U.S. official.
""From the beginning, the president has been clear about his commitment to achieving a full and comprehensive ceasefire,"" said National Security Council Spokesman James Hewitt. ""We do not comment on the details of ongoing negotiations.""
The U.S. Treasury, which implements most U.S. sanctions, did not respond to a request for comment.
An approval by Trump of new sanctions, which would follow the Wednesday signing of a U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal that he heavily promoted as part of his peace effort, could signify a hardening of his stance towards the Kremlin.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 the United States and its allies have added layer upon layer of sanctions on the country. While the measures have been painful for Russia's economy, Moscow has found ways to circumvent the sanctions and continue funding its war.
Trump ""has been bending over backwards to give Putin every opportunity to say, 'Okay, we're going to have a ceasefire and an end to the war,' and Putin keeps rejecting him,"" said Kurt Volker, a former U.S. envoy to NATO who was U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations during Trump's first term. ""This is the next phase of putting some pressure on Russia.""
""Putin has been escalating,"" he continued. Trump ""has got the U.S. and Ukraine now in alignment calling for an immediate and full ceasefire, and Putin is now the outlier.""
Since assuming office in January, Trump has taken steps seen as aimed at boosting Russian acceptance of his peace effort, including disbanding a Justice Department task force formed to enforce sanctions and target oligarchs close to the Kremlin.
He also has made pro-Moscow statements, falsely blaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for starting the conflict and calling him a ""dictator.""
Meanwhile, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, has advocated a peace strategy that would cede four Ukrainian regions to Moscow, and has met Putin four times, most recently last week.
But three days after that meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated Putin's maximalist demands for a settlement and Moscow’s forces have pressed frontline attacks and missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities, claiming more civilian casualties.
Reuters reported in March that the United States was drawing up a plan to potentially give Russia sanctions relief but Trump in recent weeks has expressed frustration with Putin's foot-dragging on ending the invasion and last Saturday held a ""very productive"" one-on-one meeting in the Vatican with Zelenskiy.
The next day, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that he was ""strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions and Tariffs on Russia"" that would remain until a ceasefire and final peace deal.

Volker said that Russia has been earning hard currency that funds its military through oil and gas sales to countries like India and China and that it would be ""very significant"" if Trump slapped secondary sanctions on such deals.
Secondary sanctions are those where one country seeks to punish a second country for trading with a third by barring access to its own market, a particularly powerful tool for the United States because of the size of its economy.

During a conclave, cardinals vote through a secret ballot. A two-thirds majority is required for the election. After each round of submissions, ballots are read aloud and then burned. The ashes are used to notify audiences around the world and onlookers in St. Peter’s Square of the election’s status.

The right-wing Reform UK Party saw a series of electoral wins early Friday after it secured parliamentary, mayoral and several local election seats in what leader Nigel Farage said is proof that Reform UK is ""now the opposition party to this Labour government.""
Farage, who predicted earlier this year in an interview with Fox News Digital that there would be a ""political revolution,"" said the centurylong, two-party system that has dominated British politics was ""now dead"" after both the liberal Labour Party and Conservative Party saw losses in a Thursday election.
Reform UK secured a fifth parliamentary seat after Sarah Pochin flipped the Runcorn & Helsby constituency, which is, according to Reform leaders, considered Labour ""heartland.""

BRACE FOR A 'POLITICAL REVOLUTION' IN EUROPE, UK'S NIGEL FARAGE SAYS AFTER VANCE'S SPEECH IN MUNICH
""Victory in Runcorn & Helsby proves we are now the opposition party to this Labour government,"" Farage said on X. ""With this and other results tonight, it’s clear that if you vote Conservative you will get Labour. But if you vote Reform, you get Reform.""
The race for the Runcorn & Helsby seat was the most closely watched race and required a full recount, after which it was confirmed that Reform secured the seat by just six votes.
Farage championed the victory as ""a small margin"" but ""a huge win.""
The Labour Party — which is led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer — currently holds 403 seats in Parliament, followed by the Conservative Party, which holds 121. Liberal Democrats hold 72 seats, while Independents hold 14. The remainder of the 40 other seats are divided between 11 other parties, including Reform.

According to Farage, the rise in Reform UK supporters suggests the Conservative Party — which he was a former member of but left in the 90s and eventually started the Brexit Party before changing the name to Reform UK in 2021 — is losing support.
""You're witnessing the end of a party that's been around since 1832,"" he told reporters, according to a Reuters report.

(Video: EFE via Reuters Connect.)
FIRST ON FOX : Fox News Digital has learned that the U.S. could withhold funding for the war against Islamist terror in Somalia until Europe, the African Union (A.U.) and the United Nations (U.N.) pay more of their ""fair"" share toward the cost of striking out and keeping the peace in the conflict-torn country.
These plans to ""prohibit"" the use of U.S. funds are key details, shown first to Fox News Digital, of a new bill to be introduced by three prominent Republican senators.
In line with President Donald Trump’s administration’s widespread moves to tighten fiscal controls in the U.S. and overseas, Sens. Jim Risch, R-Idaho., Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., are to introduce ""the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) Funding Restriction Act of 2025.""
This is ""to safeguard U.S. taxpayer funds and hold the U.N. and A.U. accountable in African peace operations,"" Risch told Fox News Digital.

The bill also seeks to mandate the U.S. to oppose any U.N. Security Council action which enables such funding.
The East African country of Somalia has been wracked for decades by attacks and insurgency from Islamist terrorists, both from ISIS and the al Qaeda-linked al-Shabab. In just the past five weeks, U.S. Africa Command reported that it has carried out four airstrikes; three against ISIS terrorists and one against al-Shabaab. At least one of these strikes, the command stated, was against multiple targets.
Chairman Risch told Fox News Digital, ""The Trump Administration has taken decisive action to counterterrorist groups across Africa, and I’m very supportive.""
However, officials from the European Union, according to Risch, plan to skew payments for the AUSSOM peacekeeping and stablization operation more toward the U.S.; in other words, make the U.S. pay more than it should, he said.
""At the U.N., our European partners are looking to skirt their financial commitments to AUSSOM in Somalia by switching to a new imbalanced funding mechanism that pushes the burden on Americans,"" he stated.

""We can’t let that stand,"" Risch continued. ""This bill will prohibit U.S. contributions to AUSSOM under this new funding scheme, until the A.U. and the U.N. can prove that they are using the funds they have responsibly, and prevent Americans from being locked into perpetually funding a broken system.""
Risch said, ""President Trump has ushered in a new era of American foreign policy where American taxpayer dollars will be used only to secure a safe and prosperous America. For far too long, our allies have taken America for a ride, and profited off of America paying the lion’s share for global security. Europe must continue to shoulder this burden.""
The other two senators sponsoring the bill, Cruz and Scott, also serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Scott told Fox News Digital, ""The United States will not allow our tax dollars to be exploited by the U.N. while our partners refuse to pay their fair share, much less for a mission that fails to spend these dollars responsibly or transparently. I am proud to join my colleagues on the AUSSOM Funding Restriction Act to ensure Americans’ interests are put first, and their tax dollars spent wisely.""

The UN80 Task Force document notes that ""overlapping mandates, inefficient use of resources, and inconsistent delivery of services"" are among the problems with proliferating agencies, funds and programs, and notes ways to integrate, consolidate, and coordinate among reformed entities to maximize the benefit for those who rely on the U.N.
As another means of reducing outlays, the task force also recommended reducing the quantity of high-level posts, establishing single entities to coordinate Peace and Security, Humanitarian Affairs, and Human Rights, and ""reduc[ing] the number of U.N. development system entities.""
Dugan said the document ""looks more like a whiteboard stream of consciousness approach that you find on the first day of a business retreat."" He said that it lacks mention of human resource improvements, finding ways of recruiting ""the very best in the world,"" or ""identifying performance measurements or metrics against the leaders of the organization, branches, [or] offices.""
Dugan said that the task force is also missing the important confidence-building measures needed to increase buy-in from members, to keep them ""impressed and enthusiastic"" about U.N. programs. ""They’re assuming that they are the leaders that are the right people at the right time."" Dugan said this is ""a real shortcoming.""

""I don’t think they have the confidence of the world community or the talents or the resources to hold out another year and a half under this regime of Secretary Guterres,"" Dugan said. Rather than utilize the ""Noah’s Ark management mentality"" of attempting to ""weather the storm,"" Dugan said that the U.N. must ""get very creative very quickly with what they have at hand.""
Dugan noted that the U.N. has gone through a ""fall-off in relevance"" with its lack of involvement in ""real world dynamics between member states."" He urged the organization to identify ""the multilateral collateral, meaning we’ve got to identify what’s good, and then we have to get rid of what’s damaged after eight years.""
DOGE USAID BUDGET CUTS HIT UN IN ‘WORST LIQUIDITY CRISIS SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT’
In response to concerns shared by Dugan, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, said that the memo ""is the result of an exercise to generate ideas and thoughts from senior officials on how to achieve the Secretary-General’s vision"" and is one ""of the three work streams that we are working on.""
Dujarric pointed to a speech Guterres delivered in March when introducing the UN80 Initiative, in which he called for an ""ambitious reform agenda to strengthen how we work and deliver."" Guterres said this involves increasing transparency and accountability, being more effective and cutting costs, and decentralizing decisions to serve those who rely on the U.N.

Dujarric also mentioned a speech Guterres gave eight years ago in September 2017, when he lamented the Byzantine bureaucracy that hampers progress at the U.N., and said that he was ""pursuing sweeping management reform – to simplify procedures and decentralize decisions, with greater transparency, efficiency and accountability.""
For Dugan, Guterres’ failure to attempt those ""sweeping"" reforms prior to 2025 is an indication that regime change is needed. He reiterated that ""the Secretary-General’s ‘Trust me’ window dressing is no longer convincing us to pay full retail.""

U.S. contributions to the U.N. may also take a hit. In April, a White House Office of Management and Budget passback to the State Department indicated the desire to end funding for international organizations, including the U.N.
Other countries are also falling short with contributions. In March, Guterres’ spokesperson Farhan Haq told Fox News Digital that member states’ non-payment of dues had forced the closure of one staff entrance to the U.N. headquarters in New York City at the time.

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-open-talks-trump-admin-lowering-tariffs-ministry-says","China open to talks with Trump admin on lowering tariffs, ministry says","Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang joins ‘Fox Report’ to break down China’s move to waive tariffs on certain U.S. goods and analyze the broader implications of the ongoing trade battle with the Trump administration.
China is ""evaluating"" an offer from the U.S. to hold talks on tariffs, according to a Friday statement from the Chinese Commerce Ministry. This shift in tone could leave the door open for the world’s two largest economies to deescalate the trade war that has left global markets in turmoil.
""The U.S. has recently taken the initiative on many occasions to convey information to China through relevant parties, saying it hopes to talk with China,"" the ministry said in a statement, according to a Reuters translation. The ministry also said that Beijing was ""evaluating this.""
However, while Beijing appears to be open to negotiations, the Chinese Commerce Ministry warned that it would not be forced into making a bad deal. According to the Reuters translation, the ministry said that ""attempting to use talks as a pretext to engage in coercion and extortion would not work.""
President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
TRUMP SAYS CHINA'S XI CALLED HIM AMID ONGOING CONFUSION OVER TRADE TALKS
On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told FOX Business’ Maria Bartiromo on ""Mornings with Maria"" that he believed Beijing was looking to reach an agreement with the U.S.
""I am confident that the Chinese will want to reach a deal. And as I said, this is going to be a multi-step process. First, we need to de-escalate. And then the over time we will start focusing on a larger trade deal,"" Bessent said.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks during a briefing with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.
TRUMP WAGERS US ECONOMY IN HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBLE AT 100-DAY MARK
President Donald Trump announced sweeping global tariffs last month. He slapped a 145% tariff on Chinese imports. Meanwhile, Beijing put a 125% tariff on U.S. imports. However, the country recently waived the tariff on a host of American-made products.
There were already exemptions for some pharmaceuticals, microchips and aircraft engines, but China added an exemption for ethane imports, according to Reuters.
Beijing’s change in messaging regarding the tariffs comes in stark contrast to its April 23 comments during a U.N. Security Council Arria-formula meeting on ""The Impact of Unilateralism and Bullying Practices on International Relations."" At that meeting, China accused the U.S. of using tariffs to bully the rest of the world.

""Under the guise of reciprocity and fairness, the U.S. is playing a zero-sum game, which is essentially about subverting the existing international economic and trade order by means of tariffs, putting U.S. interests above the common good of the international community and advancing hegemonic ambitions of the U.S. at the cost of the legitimate interest of all countries,"" Chinese U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong said in his opening remarks.
A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the meeting was ""a waste of U.N. Security Council members’ time."" The spokesperson also slammed the meeting as an example of China’s manipulation of ""the multilateral system to support its economic, political, and security interests.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/former-ambassador-says-ukraine-victory-key-countering-china-russia","Former ambassador says Ukraine victory is key to countering China, Russia","Former U.S. ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder breaks down the 'roadblock' President Donald Trump is hitting with Russian President Vladimir Putin over ending the Ukraine war on 'Fox Report.'
Former U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) James Gilmore is urging the Trump administration to repurpose funds cut from USAID to counter the growing global influence of China and Russia.
Gilmore agrees with President Donald Trump that making cuts to foreign funding requires a ""scalpel, not a hatchet,"" but asserts that more can be done to strategically reform foreign aid.
""The decisions we make today will create the world of tomorrow. If we start by abandoning foreign assistance, that new world will be run by China and our adversaries,"" Gilmore told Fox News Digital. ""Now more than ever, the U.S. needs to build up our military and national security strength while deploying a robust ‘soft’ power strategy and political initiative to counter China and Russia's growing global influence.""

However, Gilmore stressed in a recent op-ed that ""every dollar"" of foreign aid must make America safer and stronger, and align with U.S. national strategy. He views aid spent in this way as an investment.
Additionally, Gilmore told Fox News Digital that he is concerned about rising isolationism among Republicans, especially as America’s adversaries use soft-power tactics to spread their influence.
""When America pulls back from global leadership, instability blooms, and our enemies take advantage,"" Gilmore warned in his op-ed, adding that in the absence of American leadership ""weak states become breeding grounds for terrorism and drug cartels.""

FORMER USAID OFFICIAL WARNS CHINA IS ALREADY LOOKING TO FILL VOID LEFT BY PAUSED PROGRAMS
Both China and Russia have invested in economic development efforts in recent years, particularly in Africa. The continent took a major hit when several USAID programs, including those aimed at combating hunger and disease, were shut down.
In February 2024, Russia claimed to have sent more than 220,000 tons of free grain to six African nations, according to Reuters.
A few months later, in November 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered Africa his country’s ""total support"" in fighting terrorism and extremism, the BBC reported.
China has also made major investments in economic development across the globe. According to a 2024 report from the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, China has increased its development spending by 525% over the last 15 years.
In September 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged $51 billion in funding over the course of three years, Reuters reported.

Gilmore told Fox News Digital that the key to countering Chinese and Russian aggression is victory in Ukraine. He views the ongoing war as a ""pivot to the future,"" and said the U.S. cannot let Russia win.
""Ukraine is on the frontline of a new global war between democracies and authoritarian regimes that is being waged with both military and soft power,"" Gilmore told Fox News Digital.
""If Ukraine is conquered by force, Putin will continue his long-term goal of reassembling the Russian empire, and compromising the safety, independence and of Europe, and challenge Europe's friendship with the U.S.  A defeat of Ukraine will require more investment of resources to defend our allies.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-us-main-enemy-estonian-foreign-minister-says","For Putin, 'US is the main enemy,' Estonian foreign minister says","Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson has the latest on Estonia bolstering defense spending amid renewed fears of Russian aggression on ‘Special Report.’
TALLINN, Estonia — Estonia's top diplomat thinks Russia's war on Ukraine goes well beyond the front lines.
""This is not about Europe. I think that for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and for Russia, the U.S. is the main enemy, like historically,"" Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told Fox News in an exclusive interview in Estonia's capital, Tallinn.
""He has a plan to restore the Soviet empire, and this is exactly what he's doing. Ukraine is just one example,"" he added.
Nine years ago, Tsahkna, then serving as Estonia's defense minister, watched as 120,000 Russian soldiers massed just across the border, ready to invade his country in just 48 hours.
WARNING TO TRUMP NUCLEAR NEGOTIATORS ABOUT DECEPTIVE IRAN VERSION OF ‘ART OF THE DEAL’

""Now these troops are gone. They were sent to Ukraine, and they are literally dead,"" Tsahkna spoke from the foreign ministry Wednesday, where he now serves as Estonia's top diplomat.
""At the moment, I don't expect any kind of the full-scale military aggression against NATO because Russia is running out of power in Ukraine, to be honest,"" Tsahkna added. ""Economically, they're very weak, but of course, we see that Russia is preparing again.""
Estonia is not taking any chances.
To ward off any potential invasion on NATO’s eastern flank, Estonia recently announced it would spend over 5% of its GDP on defense next year, a goal President Donald Trump has requested from all NATO countries.
EUROPE STEPS UP TO FUND ITS OWN DEFENSE, PROVIDE SECURITY FOR UKRAINE AFTER TRUMP THREATS
On Wednesday, Estonia officially welcomed the arrival of six HIMARS satellite-guided rocket systems made in the U.S. It’s a weapon that has been used in Ukraine effectively, destroying targets up to 186 miles away.
""We have created, as Estonians, the rule that if the U.S. is investing $1, we are adding $10 on top of that. And all this going back to [sic] goes back to the U.S. economy, and we are getting the capabilities,"" Tsahkna said.
In recent weeks, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland and Poland announced they would withdraw from the Ottawa Convention, which bans the use of anti-personnel land mines. Russia, which is not party to the treaty, has deployed mines in the roughly 20% of Ukraine it now occupies.
Estonia is a small country of 1.3 million people located in Eastern Europe, with an area about twice the size of New Jersey. It shares a 214-mile border with Russia.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, Estonia has cut off all energy imports from Russia. Today, it receives 80% of its natural gas from the U.S.
Not all countries have been as defiant. The 27-nation European Union, of which Estonia is a member, has only cut 60% of its energy imports from Russia. Last year, the European Union spent more on Russian oil and gas than aid to Ukraine, according to the Kiel Institute.
The Kremlin is also waging war on another front as well. ""Russia is using religion of the church as a tool for their own political goals,"" Tsahkna said.
The foreign minister also weighed in on Russia's proposed three-day ceasefire surrounding its May 9 celebrations marking the end of World War II. ""This is not that serious,"" Tsahkna replied.
RUSSIA DECLARES 3-DAY CEASEFIRE IN UKRAINE FOR WWII VICTORY DAY
Since late 2023, nearly a dozen undersea cables in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland have been cut. Russia is suspected but ""it’s very hard to say exactly,"" Tsahkna said. Over 14 people from Russia’s so-called shadow fleet have been arrested. China is suspected of carrying out at least one act of sabotage as well.

NATO deployed warships off the coast of Estonia in January, and since then no cables have been cut, officers told Fox while on two ships in the Gulf of Finland on Tuesday.
When asked about the prospects of a ceasefire and eventual end of hostilities in Ukraine, Tsahkna replied with a warning:
""President Trump has said very clearly that he wants to have peace. The Ukraine [sic] people want to have a [sic] peace — and I think that this is something that Putin doesn't want.""
Tsahkna does not believe Putin would ever use nuclear weapons, calling such a move ""political suicide.""

""He's just brutal, but also sometimes, from the Western part of the world, we are too weak,"" Tsahkna added. ""Putin is playing with our fears.""

Snoop Dogg is ready to respond to all the ""sellout"" comments he's received after his Crypto Ball performance during President Donald Trump's inauguration in January.
During a recent appearance on ""The Breakfast Club,"" the legendary rapper addressed the criticism he's received since his performance and announced that his new music is a direct response to the haters.
When asked if he's bothered by the negative feedback, Snoop Dogg said he isn't because he believes his performance was for a good cause.

Seeing Cassie Ventura's life shows how far she’s come since her alleged abuse at the hands of her ex, Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, years ago.
The singer and actress, known professionally as Cassie, took the stand this week while eight months pregnant with her third child with husband Alex Fine, who was in court supporting her.
The 38-year-old began testifying for the prosecution Monday, telling the story of years of alleged physical and sexual abuse, including ""freak offs,"" which were hours-long sex parties that involved drugs and sex workers.
She also alleged Diddy raped her in 2018 after she tried to leave him after their 11-year relationship.

They first started dating in 2007 after he signed her to his Bad Boy Records label.
In November 2023, Cassie filed a lawsuit against Diddy, alleging rape and abuse. The 55-year-old rapper settled the suit a day later, but more lawsuits from more accusers soon followed.
Diddy’s homes were raided last year as part of a federal sex trafficking investigation, and he was arrested in September and charged with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution.
A year ago, CNN released surveillance video that showed Diddy beating Cassie up in a hallway of a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. The video was played for the jurors this week.

After finally ending their relationship, Cassie moved on to a happier relationship with her husband, Fine.

In 2019, after putting her relationship with Diddy behind her, Cassie married personal trainer Alex Fine, 32.
The couple share two daughters, Frankie, 5, and Sunny, 4.
The couple went public with their relationship in 2018, months after her breakup with Diddy. That same year, she and Fine announced Cassie was pregnant with their first child.
After surveillance video of Diddy beating Cassie at a hotel in 2016 surfaced, Fine supported his wife, writing in part on Instagram, ""Men who hit women aren’t men. Men who enable it and protect those people aren’t men … To all the survivors, your stories are real, and people believe you.""
Cassie often professes her love for her husband on social media, writing for his birthday this March, ""There aren’t words to describe how grateful I am that I get to do this life with you! The laughter and pure joy that I get to experience with you is beyond any of my dreams and manifestations. You’ve taken care of me and my heart like no other, you’re hands down the best girl dad and I’m SO excited to see you now become a father to OUR SON!""

Cassie regularly shares photos and videos of her wholesome life with Fine and their daughters, including at the playground, toy stores, ice skating, going to the beach and doing puzzles together.

It was yesterday and it wasn’t. Now I don’t understand time at all,"" Cassie wrote on Instagram on Frankie’s third birthday in 2022.""Frankie Stone, there are no words to describe the love that I have for you.

""She is not only Frankie’s little best friend but Cassie and I as well,"" he added. ""She has been the tough baby that wears dresses, loves the spice girls and Wednesday adams, sings and dances at all times, and frequently asks Uber drivers why their car smells like a diaper. Every time I wake up and see Sunny, Franks, Cass I always am thankful. Happy Iverson year Sunny cinco!""
In November 2023, Cassie filed her lawsuit against Diddy, accusing him of years of abuse. Diddy settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount just one day later. Cassie revealed in court this week that the settlement was $20 million.
""I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control,"" Cassie said in a statement at the time. ""I want to thank my family, fans and lawyers for their unwavering support.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/scarlett-johansson-takes-aim-companies-using-her-likeness-voice-ai","Scarlett Johansson takes aim at companies using her likeness, voice in AI","Actress Scarlett Johansson is speaking out against fake AI-generated sex videos online.
Scarlett Johansson has continued to share her opinion on artificial intelligence — and she has some suggestions on how the technology should be regulated in the future.
During an interview with Vanity Fair, the actress spoke out about AI companies that have used her likeness and allegedly her voice in the past. She told the outlet that she is advocating for legislation to be made around evolving technology.
""There has to be some agreed-upon set of boundaries in order for [AI] to not be detrimental. I wish more people in the public eye would support and speak out about that — I don’t know why that’s not the case,"" Johansson said.

This is not the first time Johansson has warned about the dangers of AI.
In 2024, Johansson claimed she had been asked to voice OpenAI’s Chatbot by CEO Sam Altman, but turned down the job, only for people to notice that the feature, named ""Sky,"" sounded almost exactly like the actress.
""There has to be some agreed-upon set of boundaries in order for [AI] to not be detrimental. I wish more people in the public eye would support and speak out about that — I don’t know why that’s not the case.""
""Particularly with the A.I. piece. It was like: If that can happen to me, how are we going to protect ourselves from this? There’s no boundary here; we're setting ourselves up to be taken advantage of,"" the 40-year-old told InStyle Magazine in March.
In a statement to NPR following the release of ""Sky,"" Johansson said, ""When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference. Mr. Altman even insinuated that the similarity was intentional, tweeting a single word ‘her’ — a reference to the film in which I voiced a chat system, Samantha, who forms an intimate relationship with a human.""

The ""Black Widow"" star’s legal team sent OpenAI letters asking for an explanation about how the AI assistant’s voice came to be, and the company later agreed to take down ""Sky.""

Altman later issued a statement to Fox News Digital regarding ""Sky's"" voice.
""The voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson's, and it was never intended to resemble hers. We cast the voice actor behind Sky’s voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson. Out of respect for Ms. Johansson, we have paused using Sky’s voice in our products. We are sorry to Ms. Johansson that we didn’t communicate better,"" the statement read.

Speaking with InStyle, Johansson said she’s become a reluctant voice in the AI conversation, but won’t back down either.

""I don't need to be beating the drum the whole time. That’s not my place. But, also, I'm not afraid of being invalidated,"" she said.
Johansson added that after a Hollywood career that began as a child, she’s not shy about speaking up for herself.

""But now I see that I actually built something that… that I have a place here. And because of that, I've been able to stand up for myself and not feel like I would disappear. I can shoulder it,"" she said.
The ""Avengers"" star also took legal action in 2023 against an AI image-generating app called Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook & Avatar for using her voice and likeness in an ad posted on X.
Johansson’s attorney told Variety, ""We do not take these things lightly. Per our usual course of action in these circumstances, we will deal with it with all legal remedies that we will have.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/smokey-robinson-under-criminal-investigation-la-sheriff-sexual-assault-allegations","Smokey Robinson under criminal investigation by LA sheriff for sexual assault allegations","Smokey Robinson was honored at the MusiCares Persons of the Year event alongside Berry Gordy. He talked about the impact they have had on the industry and his future plans to retire.
Smokey Robinson is being investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) after he was accused of sexual assault by four anonymous former employees.
On Thursday, the sheriff's department confirmed that it has opened an investigation into the allegations made against the 85-year-old singer in a lawsuit filed last Tuesday.
""The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Special Victims Bureau is actively investigating criminal allegations involving William Robinson aka ‘Smokey Robinson.’ The investigation is in the early stages, and we have no further comment,"" a representative for the LASD said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.
Robinson's lawyer, Christopher Frost, responded in a statement to Fox News Digital, writing, ""We are aware that a police report has now been filed by the Plaintiffs in the civil lawsuit. It is clear to us what is happening here. Plaintiffs filed a police report only after they filed a $50 million lawsuit. ""

He continued, ""This means only that the police are now required to investigate. We welcome that investigation, which involves Plaintiffs who continue to hide their identities, because exposure to the truth is a powerful thing.""

""We feel confident that a determination will be made that Mr. Robinson did nothing wrong, and that this is a desperate attempt to prejudice public opinion and make even more of a media circus than the Plaintiffs were previously able to create,"" Frost added.
""The record will ultimately demonstrate that this is nothing more than a manufactured lawsuit intended to tarnish the good names of Smokey and Frances Robinson, for no other reason than unadulterated avarice.""
Robinson is accused of assaulting and raping four former housekeepers who worked at his Chatsworth home between 2006 and 2024, according to the lawsuit. The accusers are seeking $50 million in damages.

In addition to the allegations against Robinson, his wife Frances has been under fire for allegedly perpetuating a toxic work environment.
The accusers claimed Frances ""failed to take the appropriate corrective action to prevent Defendant Smokey Robinson’s deviant misconduct"" despite having ""full knowledge of his prior acts of sexual misconduct, having settled cases with other women that suffered and experienced similar sexual assaults perpetuated by him.""
According to the lawsuit, one of the four accusers, Jane Doe 1, worked for the Motown legend from January 2023 through February 2024 but was forced to resign due to Robinson's ""repeated sexual assaults and sexual harassment against her.""

She claimed Robinson sexually assaulted her ""at least 7 times"" while she was employed by the family. She was unwilling to report the incidents due to ""her fear of losing her livelihood, familial reprisal, public embarrassment, shame… the possible adverse effect on her immigration status…""
""Plaintiffs were severely harmed and humiliated by Defendant Smokey Robinson’s conduct,"" the women claimed in their lawsuit.
In addition to sexual battery and assault, the four women sued for negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, gender violence and a number of labor code violations.

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez made a splash on the Cannes Film Festival red carpet — but things weren't completely as they seemed.
A couple, who share an uncanny resemblance to the famed businessman and his soon-to-be wife, turned heads while walking the red carpet at the premiere of ""Dossier 137"" on Thursday.
The unknown woman posed for photos while walking the red carpet in a strapless black and white dress with floral designs on top which transitioned into a full black skirt.

KATY PERRY, LAUREN SANCHEZ SHOW OFF BLUE ORIGIN FLIGHT SUITS THAT BRING ‘SPICE TO SPACE’
While these two may not actually be Sánchez and Bezos, the famous couple are expected to attend the film festival, as Sánchez is set to receive the 2025 Global Gift Women Empowerment Award at the annual Global Gift Foundation charity gala.
The foundation announced its decision to honor Sánchez on Instagram, calling her ""a powerful voice for women around the world"" whose many qualities, including her ""strength, vision, and compassion uplift and inspire.""
""Through her leadership, she opens doors for others to rise,"" the post read. ""Whether advocating for climate justice with the Bezos Earth Fund or creating safe, dignified spaces for families through This Is About Humanity, Lauren leads with purpose, and brings others with her.""
Sánchez was recently in the news as part of the all-female flight crew of the Blue Origin New Shepard mission. She was joined by pop star Katy Perry, American TV personality Gayle King, STEMBoard CEO Aisha Bowe, bioastronautics research scientist Amanda Nguyễn and film producer Kerianne Flynn.

During the 10-minute, 21-second mission, the women traveled more than 62 miles above Earth, crossing the internationally recognized boundary of space and experienced a few minutes of zero gravity.
""I came back to Earth… but something in me is still up there,"" Sánchez wrote on Instagram after the space flight. ""There’s a silence in space that somehow made everything feel more alive. I looked down at our planet and felt how fragile and beautiful it all is. And how deeply connected we are.""
Following the mission, many celebrities shared their opinion on the decision to go through with it, with some questioning whether it was a good use of resources.
Actress Olivia Wilde shared a meme of Perry getting off the spacecraft, writing, ""Billion dollars bought some good memes I guess.""

""I would love to have them come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees that don't just work here but they put their heart and soul into this vehicle,"" she said. ""They love their work and they love the mission and it's a big deal for them.""
""So when we hear comments like that, I just say, 'Trust me. Come with me. I'll show you what this is about, and it's, it's really eye-opening,'"" she added.

Legendary comedian Jerry Seinfeld faced anti-Israel hecklers while leaving a New York Knicks game. Seinfeld, sporting a Knicks hat, took it in stride and laughed in the protester’s face as she accused him of supporting ""the genocide of babies in Gaza.""
A video of the incident, posted on the Palestinian Assembly for Liberation’s Instagram page, appears to show the comedian heading to his car as someone off-camera begins shouting at him.
""F--- you, Jerry Seinfeld! Free Palestine,"" the off-camera person yelled at Seinfeld. ""You support the genocide of babies in Gaza!""
The comedian instantly began laughing at the protester and responded by saying, ""Only you."" However, the protester continued shouting at him over his support for Israel and even called him a ""rabid f---ing dog.""

HBO MAX COMEDIAN CONDEMNS 'MASS MURDER' OF GAZANS, DECLARES 'NEVER AGAIN IS NOW'
Seinfeld has been open about his support for Israel for years but became even more vocal after Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre. Just days after the brutal attacks, Seinfeld joined a group of over 2,000 leaders in the entertainment industry in signing a letter supporting Israel.
""As Israel takes the necessary steps to defend its citizens in the coming days and weeks, social media will be overrun by an orchestrated misinformation campaign spearheaded by Iran. We urge everyone to remember the horrific images that came out of Israel and to not amplify or fall for their propaganda,"" the letter, initiated by Creative Community for Peace (CCFP), read.
At the end of the letter, CCFP also expressed the desire for Israelis and Palestinians to one day ""live side-by-side in peace.""
For over a year and a half, hecklers have yelled at the comedian at shows and in public. This latest incident comes just months after social media influencer Subway DJ tried to ambush him by asking for a selfie with Seinfeld before declaring, ""Free Palestine."" The influencer then looked to Seinfeld, seemingly trying to get him to agree, but the comedian delivered a one-liner before walking away: ""I don’t care about Palestine.""

Shortly after the war in Gaza began, Seinfeld and his wife, Jessica Sklar, visited Israel in December 2023 and met with survivors of Oct. 7.

""While it was an intimate gathering, there were several additional guests, including VIPs and film executives. Brooklyn and Nicola had a wonderful time and found Harry and Meghan to be particularly kind, caring and generous.""
Fox News Digital reached out to Archewell, which handles the offices of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as well as the Beckhams, for comment. The Sun was the first to report on the swanky supper.

Beckham, 26, and Peltz, 30, have been noticeably missing from the Beckham family’s gatherings, including patriarch David Beckham’s 50th birthday bash, People reported. According to the outlet, Beckham and Peltz were invited, but there are ""tensions"" between the young couple and the family. Still, ""the relationship is definitely not beyond repair.""

Beckham, the eldest son of David and Victoria Beckham, said ""I do"" to Peltz, an American actress, in 2022. They have been together since 2019. According to reports, Peltz has bumped heads with her famous in-laws, sparking rumors of an ongoing rift.
Similarly, the Sussexes have faced their own family drama. The couple had previously cited hostility and racist attitudes by the press and royal establishment, as well as a lack of support from the palace, as their reasons behind their exit. They went on to air their grievances in interviews and documentaries. Harry’s tell-all 2023 memoir ""Spare,"" filled with private details about embarrassing revelations, made things worse.

In a May 2 interview with the BBC, Harry said that his father, King Charles III, ""won’t speak to him,"" as the monarch, 76, battles an undisclosed form of cancer. The 40-year-old admitted to the network that he does not know ""how long [my father] has"" as the monarch continues cancer treatment. Still, the father of two stressed that he’s ready to make amends with his family.
""I would love reconciliation with my family,"" said Harry. ""There's no point in continuing to fight anymore.""
Amid the family drama, Harry and Markle’s sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, wore a tailored olive suit designed by Victoria to a British Fashion Council event in London on Wednesday. Several royal experts previously claimed to Fox News Digital that Middleton's relationship with the Sussexes took a dramatic turn following the couple's departure.

According to The Sun, Harry is ""fully aware"" of Beckham’s ""situation"" with his parents and offered Brooklyn his unwavering support as someone who has been through ""similar"" rifts. The outlet reported that the couple were said to be ""very empathetic and very kind"" to Beckham and Peltz. Markle and Peltz, in particular, reportedly found ""common ground.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/country-icon-george-strait-brings-fans-tears-during-emotional-moment-concert","Country icon George Strait brings fans to tears during emotional moment at concert","Country singer Brian Kelley shares what being an American means to him and expresses his gratitude for the thousands of heroes who fought to 'protect our freedom.'
The ""King of Country Music"" George Strait made fans emotional during a recent concert.
At a performance in Philadelphia last week, Strait, 72, performed his 2011 song ""I'll Always Remember You,"" which contains a spoken bridge about his potential retirement. When a fan shared a video of the performance on social media, many fans expressed sadness at the subject matter.
""I have maybe five good years to sing my songs for you, folks,"" Strait said in the song. ""But hell, it's been around 50 now. And I still love it just as much as I ever did. When I walk through those curtains and I see your smiling faces, my feet don't touch the ground again until I walk back out and get on that bus. I don't know how many more years I can do this. I figure a few. I do want you to know, though, when I do walk off this stage and I'm settled in far away from all this, I'll still hear your screams and cheers in my mind, and I will always remember you.""

While loyal fans became emotional at seeing Strait’s performance of ""I’ll Always Remember You,"" his reps confirmed with Fox News Digital that he performs this at every show.
In 2012, Strait announced his retirement from touring; however, he occasionally performs for his country fans from time to time.

""So many Texans grew up on George Strait, so to have him perform in the heart of Aggieland where he is so beloved, was something really special. From packed floor seats to the top rows on the highest deck, everyone was all in for George.""

After Jamie Lee Curtis's self-esteem was crushed by a cinematographer at a young age, the legendary actress made a life-changing decision she still regrets.
""He was like, ‘Yeah, I'm not shooting her today. Her eyes are baggy.’ And I was 25, so for him to say that, it was very embarrassing,"" Curtis, who was filming the 1985 movie ""Perfect"" at the time, said during Sunday's episode of 60 Minutes. ""So, as soon as the movie finished, I ended up having some plastic surgery.""
""That's just not what you want to do when you're 25 or 26,"" she continued. ""And I regretted it immediately and have kind of sort of regretted it since.""

The Golden Globe Award-winning actress, who has been open about her past dependency on drugs throughout the years, said she became ""enamored"" with the effects of drugs.
""I became very enamored with the warm bath of an opiate,"" said Curtis. ""You know, drank a little bit … never to excess, never any big public demonstrations. I was very quiet, very private about it, but it became a dependency, for sure.""
Curtis, in 1978, first had plastic surgery at age 25.  ((Photo by Paul Harris/Getty Images))
In 2019, Curtis described her former self as a ""controlled drug addict and alcoholic"" in Variety’s ""The Recovery Issue.""
""I never did it when I worked,"" she told the outlet at the time. ""I never took drugs before 5 p.m. I never ever took painkillers at 10 in the morning. It was that sort of late afternoon and early evening — I like to refer to it as the warm-bath feeling of an opiate. . . . I chased that feeling for a long time.""
Curtis attended her first recovery meeting in February 1999, after reading Tom Chiarella's essay ""Vicodin, My Vicodin"" in Esquire magazine.
""I was terrified [of being recognized]. I was just terrified that someone in the recovery community was going to betray my trust,"" Curtis confessed. ""But it is my experience that that doesn’t really happen and that my fear was unfounded.""

In 2021, she opened up about the plastic surgery procedure that led her down the dangerous road of addiction.
""I tried plastic surgery, and it didn’t work. It got me addicted to Vicodin. I’m 22 years sober now,"" Curtis shared with Fast Company at the time.
""The current trend of fillers and procedures, and this obsession with filtering, and the things that we do to adjust our appearance on Zoom are wiping out generations of beauty. Once you mess with your face, you can’t get it back.""
That same year, Curtis celebrated her sobriety journey on social media.

The actress took to Instagram, where she posted a throwback photo of herself holding an alcoholic beverage.
""A LONG time ago… In a galaxy far, far away… I was a young STAR at WAR with herself,"" the 62-year-old wrote. ""I didn't know it then. I chased everything. I kept it hidden. I was [as] sick as my secrets.""
""With God's grace and the support of MANY people who could relate to all the 'feelings' and a couple of sober angels...I've been able to stay sober, one day at a time, for 22 years,"" Curtis continued. ""I was a high bottom, pun kind of intended, so the rare photo of me proudly drinking in a photo op is very useful to help me remember. To all those struggling and those who are on the path…MY HAND IN YOURS.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/secret-lives-mormon-wives-star-braces-more-hate-ahead-explosive-second-season","'Secret Lives of Mormon Wives' star braces for more hate ahead of explosive second season","Layla Taylor expects the second season to receive more backlash from viewers.
As ""The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives"" gears up for its second season, one breakout star is bracing for the next wave of criticism.
In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Layla Taylor — who famously threw herself a divorce party during the Hulu show's first season — opened up about the backlash the show has received from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She also revealed the ""intense pressure"" she often feels about oversharing aspects of her life on TV, and explained why she foresees ""more hate"" and judgment to follow this explosive second season.
""It's been pretty positive for me,"" Taylor, 24, said of the public's response so far. ""I was pretty quiet season one. I was a little bit more reserved, so I feel like there wasn't necessarily much room for people to say much about me. But for the other girls, I know that they're definitely under some heat after season one came out.""

""I think with each season there will be more and more voices that become more active and more vocal,"" she added. ""And I could see that after season two, I could see some more hate on my end. But I think overall I felt good about my intentions and what I did throughout the seasons.""
Given the title of the show, one major wave of criticism came from the LDS Church, Taylor recalled.

""I think that they've definitely kind of calmed down from their initial scare,"" she said of the LDS Church's reaction to the first season. ""I think when the show title was released before the initial show came out, definitely everyone was a little bit alarmed, and then the trailer came out and they're like, 'Oh, it's worse' in their brains. And then I think they finally saw the show and they're like, 'Okay, they're not misrepresenting. I think that they're just showing members at different levels within their faith that still have a genuine basis of relationship with God and a relationship with Jesus.'""

""And that's what it comes down to,"" she added. ""I just feel like we weren't trying to come at the church in any way. I think they were maybe afraid that we were going to drag them. I don't think that's anyone's intentions. Even the people like myself that aren't active Mormons and Jessi [Ngatikaura] and a couple of the other girls, I think that we just wanted to show what our journey within their religion has been.""
This idea of fitting the LDS mold was a constant topic of conversation during the show's first season. This next season will see certain cast members struggle with the repercussions of their actions from last season.
Jen Affleck's husband, Zac — who received backlash after mistreating his wife during the first season — admitted to having some ""nasty"" interactions with churchgoers over the past year.

""Jen still wants to go [to church] and I think eventually we will,"" Zac admitted. ""I feel not accepted. I also feel honestly embarrassed. We've had a couple nasty interactions with people [at church].""
""I had 50 to 100 DM's saying, ‘You deserve to die’, ‘If I saw you in person, I’d kill you,'"" he related.
""If you have a good relationship with God and you're trying to figure it out with Him, I don't think anything else matters,"" Dakota Mortensen, Taylor Frankie Paul's on-again, off-again boyfriend, told Zac.
The stars of the Hulu series have been outspoken about the mixed reactions they've received since season one.  (Disney/Fred Hayes)
The first season of the Hulu series followed the dramatic aftermath of the swinging sex scandal exposed by Paul, the self-proclaimed creator of #MomTok.
Paul and her ex had agreed to a lifestyle that included having multiple partners, although the pair decided as a couple that they ""wouldn't go all the way."" When the scandal broke, she admitted that she ""did step out of the agreement"" and cheated on her ex with Mortensen.

""I want people to have a better understanding of who I am,"" Paul told People magazine at the time. ""I wanted to be vulnerable and show people that when you hit rock bottom, there is hope.""
Ahead of the series premiere last year, some of the stars voiced their intentions of exposing their lives as ""Mormon wives.""
""I hope when the show comes out that the church members will be a little more open-minded and realize that we're not against them, we're with them — we're just showing our sins publicly,"" Jessi Ngatikaura told the Daily Mail ahead of the premiere.
""I feel like it's a lot of projection,"" Paul added. ""At the end of the day we're not representing those people, we're representing ourselves and our stories — and our message is that we're not all the same and we don't all live the same. There's different spectrums of Mormonism and it's unfortunate that we're getting judged so harshly before they've even seen it.""

From exposing their deepest, personal secrets to facing bouts of betrayal and jealousy, Taylor said putting their lives on reality television has come with ""intense pressure.""
""There is definitely intense pressure to share everything. And then if you don't share everything, then you're hiding things,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""And then I get comments all the time about the plastic surgeries I've done to myself, or I get comments from people saying like, 'Oh, I didn't even know you're a mom. You don't share your kids. Why do you hide them?' And my perspective on that, I'm like, I'm protecting them actually from people who make unnecessary comments.""
Taylor, who is a divorced mom of two, said she quickly learned that she's not going to have the approval of everyone.

""I feel like it's just you are never going to have everyone be your fan,"" she said. ""I feel like I just try to drown out everything because you don't want the ego side of yourself to get too high, but then you don't want to get overwhelmed by all the hate. And I just try to remember that at my core, who I am, and they show such— even though we're filming for months at a time, they're still showing such minimal parts of our lives. Just the big things and the big crazy moments and the moments that you lose your cool one day or the moments that you're crying. So they don't show everything as vulnerable as we can be.""
""You just have to remember that it's a very small percentage that the world's seeing, and if they jump to conclusions off of that small percentage, and that's on them, but the people in your life know who you are,"" she added.
WATCH: ‘SECRET LIVES OF MORMON WIVES’ STAR CONFRONTS CHURCH BACKLASH AHEAD OF EXPLOSIVE SECOND SEASON
While being on a reality show has its ups and downs, Taylor said she's learning so much about herself and applying those lessons to everyday life.
""I feel like I'm still learning so much about myself. I am only 24, so young, and I got married at a young age, and I feel like I was thrown into being a wife and then thrown into motherhood very fast and abruptly. Blessed, obviously from my babies. But I think that I'm still learning myself and learning who I am as a person and learning to not shift myself because of who I'm with,"" she explained.
""And that's something that I was experiencing in my [last] relationship,"" she added of her recent and now ex-boyfriend, Cameron. ""And I was kind of molding myself into what he wanted for a partner. And looking back, I am never going to do that again. You either like me for who I am or you don't like me at all. And that's something that I'm learning and growing with time is accepting myself for who I truly am at my core, and my right person will like me for who I am.""
The second season of ""The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives"" is now streaming on Hulu.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/king-charles-prince-harrys-painful-feud-damaging-monarchs-reign-gutted-son-remains-furious-expert","King Charles, Prince Harry’s painful feud ‘damaging’ monarch’s reign as gutted son remains furious: expert","Royal commentator and broadcaster Neil Sean weighs in on the new interview from Prince Harry.
King Charles is being urged to make peace with his son – or it could cost his legacy.
Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams claimed to Fox News Digital that Prince Harry’s pleas to reconcile with his family, while also airing dirty laundry, could undermine Charles’ leadership as a monarch who is battling cancer.
""Charles’ reign is not being overshadowed by the feud, but it is being damaged by it because of the huge amount of publicity,"" said Fitzwilliams. ""In Harry’s recent interview, he seemed angry and pretty gutted… It would be a serious problem for the royal family if he and Meghan launched further attacks.""

Fitzwilliams’ claims came shortly after The New York Times reported that the patriarch, 76, is being eclipsed by his estranged son whenever he airs his grievances.
""It has become a familiar pattern for the 76-year-old monarch,"" read the report. ""Two years after his coronation, his reign is shaping up as both eventful and oddly unchanging in its core narrative: that of a beleaguered father managing a messy brood.""

""Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal that rift, it could define his reign, undercutting the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness that he has long championed,"" it warned.

British royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital that the king’s feud with the Duke of Sussex is ""a test"" of not only the monarchy’s resilience, but also the king’s leadership and discipline.
""It has been extremely important and admirable that Charles has been able, despite his love for his wayward son Harry, to maintain royal protocol, family unity and to maintain the monarchy’s dignified public image,"" said Fordwich.

""A lesser man might well engage in a squalid tit-for-tat public back and forth with Harry,"" she said. His resilience, at such a vulnerable time suffering from cancer, has garnered the admiration of so many, now even more so, in stark contrast to Harry’s constant moaning.""

Harry has been estranged from his family since he and his wife, Meghan Markle, quit royal duties in 2020 and moved to California, alleging hostility and racist attitudes by the press and royal establishment. Following their royal exit, a government committee decided that Harry’s security arrangements should be decided on a case-by-case basis whenever he visits the U.K.
The couple went on to publicly detail their struggles with royal life and make eyebrow-raising accusations about ""The Firm"" in televised interviews and documentaries. Harry’s tell-all 2023 memoir ""Spare,"" stuffed with private details and embarrassing revelations, made things worse.

On May 2, Harry told the BBC he wanted to reconcile with his family after losing a court battle over his publicly funded security, which he said led his father to stop talking to him. Sources close to Harry previously told People magazine that Charles hasn’t responded to the 40-year-old’s calls or letters.

""I would love reconciliation with my family,"" said Harry. ""There’s no point in continuing to fight anymore. I don’t know how much longer my father has.""
Buckingham Palace has declined to comment to Fox News Digital about the king’s current relationship with his son. The New York Times reported that the palace pushed back on Harry’s insistence that his father could have done more to help have his police protection reinstated whenever he visits Britain.

""The royal family cannot trust the Sussexes as they constantly go to the media to air their grudges,"" Fitzwilliams claimed. ""It has also cost the monarchy some popular support, especially among the 18-24-year-olds. [But] Charles, backed by Prince William and greatly helped by Queen Camilla, is prioritizing his health and engagements. Given his errant son’s behavior, he has no choice.""
""The monarchy has a pivotal part to play in the current geopolitical situation, especially regarding links with the United States,"" he pointed out. ""If the Sussexes had remained senior working royals… they would have been an important part of this process, especially given Meghan’s American roots… Instead, they opted out after only a couple of years.""

British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard doesn’t believe Charles’ reign will be overshadowed by ""the Prince Harry debacle."" She called that idea ""a load of poppycock.""

""Throughout history, there has been royal family drama, dysfunctional family dynamics, family differences and prodigal sons,"" Chard explained. ""Time is a great healer, and soon, the much-discussed feud will be yesterday’s news.""
""King Charles… cannot be held responsible for the family fallout,"" she said. ‘He doesn’t want his son to be unhappy… he certainly doesn’t need the friction. His health is of the utmost importance. Queen Camilla will make sure his energy is spent keeping well. Prince Harry may be fragile, but he also needs to learn. He has misfired yet again with his disastrous BBC interview. When he doesn’t get his way, he hurls hurtful public [claims] toward his family.""

""King Charles cannot pander to Prince Harry’s behavior and unreasonable requests,"" Chard stressed. ""Harry is obsessive about his crusades without considering the consequences. Prince Harry wouldn’t have arranged the BBC interview if he genuinely wanted family reconciliation… Allegedly, it is thought that Prince William should be assigned the job of appeasing the Prince Harry situation on behalf of his father.

Harry said he was devastated to lose the case, which has been a source of friction with his father. Harry has met with him once briefly since his diagnosis early last year.
""He won’t speak to me because of this security stuff,"" Harry told the BBC hours after the ruling. He noted that the court verdict meant it would be impossible to safely bring his family back to the U.K.

""While King Charles has publicly championed inclusivity, the British public opinion polls reflect the national sentiment that Harry has behaved despicably in general, and certainly toward his flesh and blood,"" said Fordwich.

""Harry’s recent whinging to the BBC has further reinforced King Charles’ perception of Harry being rather a ‘loose cannon,’"" Fordwich claimed. ""Prince William is even more staunchly opposed to any form of reconciliation than his father. He urged Princess Catherine to refrain from further contact with Harry.""
Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner claimed to Fox News Digital that the royal family has more important things to worry about – and it has nothing to do with Harry.

""The destiny of the royal family is, in my view, less certain than they think,"" he said. ""Twenty-somethings in Britain see them as an outdated and unnecessary institution costing millions of pounds.

""I constantly state that it is the blood, sweat and tears of the British taxpayers who pay for their existence. They do not have a choice, in my opinion, other than to unite publicly and swallow their differences privately.""
Still, Chard doesn’t believe a royal reconciliation will happen anytime soon, even if it guarantees a greater rise in Charles’ popularity.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/legal-experts-believe-cassies-pregnancy-could-sway-jury-diddy-trial","Legal experts believe Cassie's pregnancy could sway jury in Diddy trial","Fox News correspondent CB Cotton has the latest on the seventh day of the Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sex trafficking trial on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’
Cassie Ventura testified against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs for a second day and spent hours on the stand relaying experiences from her relationship with the fallen music mogul.
Cassie, 38, appeared in a Manhattan federal court Wednesday wearing a black, long-sleeved dress. The singer was noticeably pregnant with her third child with husband Alex Fine.
While the U.S. Attorney's Office is relying on her testimony as ""Victim 1,"" legal experts told Fox News Digital her presence as a pregnant woman may sway the jury when deciding Diddy's fate.

""Cassie being pregnant may make her an even more sympathetic figure on the stand,"" criminal defense lawyer Dan Rubin exclusively told Fox News Digital.
""It certainly invokes the maternal side of the singer, and that could really impact the way some members of the jury view her. They may find it interesting that — even if it's not said out loud — Cassie is looking at the dark events of what happened through the new lens of motherhood.""
Throughout the day, jurors heard emotional testimony from Cassie as she described allegedly being raped by Diddy after their breakup. She claimed to enter rehab and pursue trauma therapy in the beginning of 2023 after ""horrible flashbacks"" on the set of a music video.

INSIDE THE DIDDY JURY ROOM: A LOOK AT WHO'S DECIDING THE RAPPER'S FATE
""Cassie being pregnant may make her an even more sympathetic figure on the stand.""
""I can't carry this anymore. I can't carry the shame, the guilt … what's right is right. What's wrong is wrong,"" Cassie told the court.
Attorney Jo-Anna Nieves told Fox News Digital, ""Cassie Ventura’s pregnancy brings a strong layer of visual and emotional impact that makes it harder for the defense to paint her as violent or dangerous.""

WATCH ON FOX NATION: WHAT DIDDY DO?
""Jurors are human, and whether they realize it or not, they often associate pregnancy with vulnerability, nurturing and innocence. That image alone makes it a tough sell to argue that she was a real physical threat or equally responsible for the violence,"" Nieves said.
""Even if the defense introduces evidence of her alleged aggression, that version of events may not line up with what the jury sees in front of them. It’s not just about the facts. It's about how those facts land and trying to position an attractive, visibly pregnant woman who also has her own celebrity status as abusive can easily flop with this jury and damage the defense’s credibility.""

Cassie's appearance as a pregnant woman ""may not change the legal standard, but it can definitely shape how jurors perceive the story and that makes the defense’s job a lot harder,"" Nieves said.

While Cassie testified about a party at Prince’s house, one juror was looking in Diddy’s direction. As Cassie described a ""bad fight"" with Diddy, the juror was focused on the disgraced music mogul. One juror shook her head in agreement after Cassie explained in detail how she didn't want to tell her mother about Diddy's alleged abuse.

Jurors heard testimony Wednesday about Diddy's alleged violent behavior. Cassie claimed Diddy went through her phone at a ""freak off"" and found an email correspondence between Cassie and rapper Kid Cudi.

Cassie and Cudi, who's full name is Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi, dated in 2011 when she was on a break in her relationship with Diddy. In the messages, Cassie allegedly relayed to Kid Cudi what toiletries she could leave at his house.
Judge Arun Subramanian presided over the court. (Jane Rosenberg)
Diddy became ""upset"" upon reading the messages, which she had kept a secret. Cassie testified she had a burner phone to keep Cudi a secret from Diddy. Cassie had already broken up with Cudi and was visiting Diddy in Arizona when he allegedly told her that he was going to blow up Cudi's car when he was out of the country.
The trio — Cassie, Diddy and Kid Cudi — at one point allegedly met to discuss the relationship and agreed that they were no longer together. In a September memo sent to Judge Robyn Tarnofsky, prosecutors alleged Diddy's co-conspirator set fire to ""individual-1's vehicle by slicing open the car's convertible top and dropping a Molotov cocktail inside the interior.""

On Wednesday, Cassie also disclosed she received a $20 million settlement 24 hours after filing a lawsuit against Diddy in November 2023.

Justin Baldoni’s lawyers have made new bombshell claims in their case against Blake Lively.
On Wednesday, Baldoni’s team filed a document claiming the ""It Ends With Us"" actress threatened her close friend, Taylor Swift, if she didn’t publicly support Lively during Lively's legal battle against her co-star, People reported.
Lively’s lawyer, Mike Gottlieb, shared a statement with Fox News Digital calling Baldoni’s claim ""categorically false.""

""We unequivocally deny all of these so-called allegations, which are cowardly sourced to supposed anonymous sources and completely untethered from reality. This is what we have come to expect from the Wayfarer parties’ lawyers, who appear to love nothing more than shooting first, without any evidence, and with no care for the people they are harming in the process,"" Gottlieb said.

""We unequivocally deny all of these so-called allegations, which are cowardly sourced to supposed anonymous sources and completely untethered from reality.""
""We will imminently file motions with the court to hold these attorneys accountable for their misconduct here.""
On Wednesday, Lively's lawyers filed a motion asking the court to strike the accusations from its docket as ""baseless, unnecessary, improper and abusive,"" they told Fox News Digital.
""It should be unnecessary to respond to anonymously sourced, baseless, allegations recklessly leveled without any supporting evidence. It is worth stating for the record, however, that each of the allegations in the Freedman Letter is unequivocally and demonstrably false. As a legal matter, the Freedman Letter is improper,"" Lively's legal team wrote.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, Lively's motion to get Baldoni's letter dismissed was granted.
Lively's spokesperson told Fox News Digital, ""It took the court less than 24 hours to see through Mr. Freedman's irrelevant, improper and inflammatory accusations, strike them, remove them from the court and warn Mr. Freedman that further misconduct may be met with sanctions.""
Baldoni’s team wrote May 14 that it believes subpoenaing Swift is necessary for this case.
""The Lively Defendants' insistence that the Subpoena seeks irrelevant information is wrong,"" Baldoni’s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, wrote.
Freedman wrote that he received a tip from an anonymous ""source who is highly likely to have reliable information."" Freedman said that the source shared that Lively asked Swift to delete specific text messages.

Freedman also alleged that Lively’s lawyers contacted Swift’s legal team ""and demanded that Ms. Swift release a statement of support for Ms. Lively."" He also said they were ""intimating that if Ms. Swift refused to do so, private text messages of a personal nature in Ms. Lively's possession would be released.""

On May 9, Swift was subpoenaed as a witness in the Lively-Baldoni legal battle.
Shortly after the news became public, a spokesperson for Swift denied the pop star had any connection to the 2024 film aside from the licensing of her song ""My Tears Ricochet,"" which was featured in the movie's trailer and used in one scene.
""Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie. She was not involved in any casting or creative decisions. She did not score the film. She never saw an edit or made any notes on the film. She did not even see ‘It Ends With Us’ until weeks after its public release and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024, headlining the biggest tour in history,"" Swift's representative previously told Fox News Digital.

""The connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, ‘My Tears Ricochet,'"" the spokesperson added. ""Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift’s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.""

Lively and Baldoni starred together in the romance drama ""It Ends with Us,"" which was based on Colleen Hoover's 2016 book and premiered in August 2024. After a press tour rife with rumors of behind-the-scenes issues between the two, Baldoni and Lively filed lawsuits against each other.

In January, Baldoni accused Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, of civil extortion, defamation and more in a $400 million lawsuit, which mentioned Swift.
The ""Jane the Virgin"" star's lawsuit followed Lively's December lawsuit accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment while filming ""It Ends With Us."" However, Baldoni insisted Lively had ""falsely"" accused him in an attempt to repair her reputation from the fallout from the movie's press tour after she allegedly took control of the film.
In an attempt to prove his claims that Lively had taken control of the movie's production, Baldoni's legal team suggested the actress had used her friendship with the globally famous Swift to threaten him. While working on the film, Lively insisted on rewriting the infamous rooftop scene. Baldoni had been hesitant about the idea, but he told the actress he would ""take a look at what she put together,"" according to the complaint.

Afterward, Lively invited Baldoni to her New York City home, where the actor said he felt Swift and Reynolds had pressured him into using the rewritten scene.
""Later, Baldoni felt obliged to text Lively to say that he had liked her pages and hadn’t needed Reynolds and her megacelebrity friend to pressure him,"" the complaint said.
""I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor [emoji] You really are a talent across the board. Really excited nd [sic] grateful to do this together,"" Baldoni's text said, according to the complaint.

Lively shared a lengthy response, referring to Swift and Reynolds as ""dragons"" who protect her.
Both sides have given no indication they intend to settle out of court. The legal conflict is scheduled to go to trial before a New York court in March 2026.

Demi Moore had one demand before she agreed to strip down to her bikini for her iconic role in 2003's ""Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle.""
On Tuesday’s episode of ""The Drew Barrymore Show,"" the actress told the host (who also starred in the film) that she learned about the scene with Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu just three weeks before filming.

Ultimately, Moore decided to sign on to the film after her three daughters — Rumer, Tallulah and Scout — convinced her.
""I had taken a break only to be with them. I stopped and was just with them until they finally were like, ‘You have to do this movie. We love the first one. You have to do this movie. And please, aren’t you going to ever work again?'"" Moore shared.

The singer is currently on his ""Quittin Time Tour.""
The feud between Zach Bryan and singer-songwriter John Moreland has escalated.
Moreland took to social media earlier this week to respond to the drama in a scathing video after Bryan removed their duet track off his album.
""OK, so I’ll just say one more thing about it… I’m gonna get back to my real life and let y’all have fun on the internet. When I was asked to be on that album, I did not know that dude. Never met him. Just a really big artist from where I’m from [Tulsa, Oklahoma], asking me to be on a record. Cool,"" Moreland explained in an Instagram video.

""First time I met him, we recorded the song. Like, didn’t have the greatest impression, but no big deal – whatever, fine. Then we record the song. The album comes out like a month later. I had met him once at that point,"" Moreland continued.
The two country singers wrote and recorded a duet called ""Memphis; The Blues"" on Bryan’s 2024 album ""The Great American Bar Scene.""
The fellow country artist claimed that if he was asked to be on Bryan’s album today, he would decline the offer, saying, ""I wouldn’t do it. I don’t want to be on an album with a dude who is a d---head to my wife and my friends right in front of me every time I see him.""

In addition to his video dig, Moreland shared a selfie on Instagram and wrote, ""Development/observations. Been stopped on the street a couple times but only by people who wanted to yell ‘f--- zach bryan’ at me. The only people who seem upset at me are little fanboi losers. Goin pretty good.""
In addition to his video dig, Moreland shared a selfie on Instagram with his latest take on the feud. (John Moreland/Instagram; Getty Images)
The feud began when Moreland criticized Bryan’s $350 million record deal last Friday.
""$350 M is a lot to pay for the f---in off-brand version of me,"" Moreland wrote to his Instagram story. ""Y'all have a great day.""
Bryan had made a new deal with his label, Warner Records, to extend his contract to include at least two more albums, according to Variety. The outlet claimed that he has also either sold or is currently in the process of selling his publishing catalog, and that together, the two deals total $350 million.
Bryan shared a screenshot of Moreland's comment, adding a response of his own.

Susan Olsen made certain sacrifices when she starred as Cindy Brady for half a decade on ""The Brady Bunch.""
Olsen was on The Chocolate Expo's panel with her ""Brady Bunch"" co-stars, Christopher Knight, Mike Lookinland and Barry Williams, when she revealed that she had to dye her hair blonde every three weeks to maintain Cindy's look.
According to People, a fan asked Olsen if she had to dye her hair to star as Cindy. Olsen was 7 when she took on the role.

Affleck and Lopez's different approaches to fame have been speculated as the cause of their separation after the premiere of Lopez's documentary, ""The Greatest Love Story Never Told,"" but the ""Air"" director emphasized it ""wasn't the cause of some major fracture.""
""Part of it was, ‘OK, if I’m going to participate in this, I want to try to do it in an honest way and in a way that’s interesting.’ Because I thought it was an interesting examination,"" Affleck explained in a cover story for GQ magazine at the time. ""There are a lot of people who I think have handled celebrity more adeptly and more adroitly than I have, Jennifer among them.""

Lopez and Affleck have previously collaborated on projects during both rounds of their relationship, first in 2002 with the films ""Gigli"" and ""Jersey Girl,"" and last year with the high-concept music film ""This is Me... Now: A Love Story"" and the accompanying documentary, ""The Greatest Love Story Never Told.""
Affleck continued, ""My temperament is to be a little bit more reserved and private than hers. As happens in relationships, you don’t always have the same attitude towards these things. And so I thought, ‘Oh, this is interesting, because how do you reconcile that?’""
""I love and support this person. I believe in them. They’re great. I want people to see that,"" he continued. ""And I think the thing that I said in that documentary or the piece that they used was where I said, ‘You don’t marry a ship captain and then say, 'Well, I don’t like going out in the water.’ You’ve got to own what you knew going into any relationship. And I think it’s important to say that wasn’t the cause of some major fracture. It’s not like you can watch that documentary and go, ‘Oh, now I understand the issues that these two had.’""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/alana-honey-boo-boo-thompson-dime-money-made-reality-show","Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson claims she's never seen a dime of money made from TLC reality show","Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.
Alana ""Honey Boo Boo"" Thompson is speaking out about her struggles as a child star.
The now-19-year-old rose to fame at the age of 5 when she appeared in a classic episode of TLC’s ""Toddlers & Tiaras."" TLC later gave her family their own reality show, ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo,"" in 2012.
Thompson claimed in a new interview with People that despite starring in the popular show, she's never seen any of the money from it. She also alleged that her mother, June ""Mama June"" Shannon, took $35,000 from her earnings during her appearance on ""Dancing with the Stars"" in 2019, only returning the money recently—but without any apology.

""There was no, ‘I’m sorry,’"" Thompson said.
Shannon has been candid about her struggle with drug addiction, sharing in the past that she went broke funding her habit. She's now sober, but for much of Thompson's childhood, she was in active addiction, to the point where Thompson's older sister, Lauryn ""Pumpkin"" Efird, took custody of her when she was 14.
""I noticed something was off about her,"" Thompson told People of Shannon's addiction. ""She started locking her doors, which really made me think, ‘Oh, what is she doing?’""

MAMA JUNE ADMITS TO A $2,500 PER DAY DRUG HABIT IN EMOTIONAL PLEA TO REUNITE WITH HER KIDS
Thompson admitted her mother’s drug addiction humiliated her, even when she attended school.
""People were like, ‘I saw your mama on the news with a busted tooth, strung out,’"" Thompson remembered. ""I’m like, ‘Great, like I didn’t see that too.’""
Still, she pushed past her hurdles and focused on her education, explaining, ""I just always told myself you know that you want to do something better with your life and bigger with your life than just being on TV, so you've got to get up and go, you've got to graduate so you can make it to college and be the nurse that you want to be.""
Thompson spent her childhood in the spotlight on a number of reality shows. (The Associated Press)
In 2019, Shannon along with her boyfriend, Geno Doak, was arrested on suspicion of drug possession following a domestic dispute at an Alabama gas station. Details about what drew police to the gas station were not released at the time. Doak had a lengthy criminal history that included arrests for theft, burglary and criminal damage to property. The couple had been dating for three years.
Around this time, Shannon began selling her belongings, and eventually her home. This was also when she lost custody of Thompson.

In 2020, Shannon and Efird met on the family's latest reality show, ""Mama June: Family Crisis,"" to discuss a path for her to return to Thompson’s life. That’s when she dropped the big confession about her past drug habits.

""The only reason I sold the house… we was dead f---ing broke,"" she explained. ""Because, you know, at that point we was doing quite a bit. I mean, it was a couple ounces a day. Our habit was $2,500 a day, if not more.""
While Shannon is now five years sober, Thompson opened up about how difficult it was to forgive her mother’s tumultuous past.
""[Forgiveness] was hard, but at the end of the day, she’s my mom. When she was bad in her addiction, I just kept thinking about the day she’d recover. We’re going pretty good. Hopefully it lasts. I just no longer have any expectations for her.""
Thompson is currently a rising junior in college, studying nursing and living in Colorado with her longtime boyfriend, Dralin Carswell, 24.
Shannon did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mobland-star-helen-mirren-has-no-time-grumpy-rich-actors","'MobLand' star Helen Mirren has no time for grumpy rich actors","Helen Mirren called out older actors for being ‘grumpy’ and complaining on set, and she praised Harrison Ford and Pierce Brosnan. Mirren acted alongside Ford on the Western drama ‘1923,’ and she is co-starring with Brosnan on ‘MobLand.’
Helen Mirren didn't hold back in voicing disdain for ""grumpy"" older actors while heaping praise on co-stars Pierce Brosnan and Harrison Ford.
The 79-year-old actress played Cara Dutton, the wife of Ford's ranch owner Jacob Dutton, on the ""Yellowstone"" spinoff ""1923,"" and she portrays Maeve Harrigan, who is married to Brosnan's crime boss Conrad Harrigan, on the new Paramount+ series ""MobLand.""
During an interview with Fox News Digital, the Academy Award winner shared her thoughts on what had surprised her about working with Ford, 82, and Brosnan, 71.
""I think with both of them, as I say, it's the way they behave on set, professionally,"" Mirren said.

""Harrison would sit around and chat with the cowboys,"" she added. ""And it was cold, it wasn't comfortable. He didn't go off to his trailer and sit in a nice, warm, comfortable trailer. He would sit in the cold with everybody else. You know, chatting to the guys, for example.""
""And Pierce — Pierce just is so great. And you know what the other thing is great about them both? They both love what they do. And I've noticed, in my profession, a lot of older actors kind of get grumpy. Actresses don't, but actors do.
""They get grumpy, and I think, what the — excuse my language — f--- do you have to be grumpy about? You're working, you've been paid a lot of money, everyone's looking after you. Well, what do you got to be grumpy about? Harrison and Pierce are so not grumpy. They're just — they love what they do. They're positive about it. It's what they do, and they love it.""
Mirren has earned praise for the chemistry she shares with Ford and Brosnan when they played her on-screen husbands. While speaking with Fox News Digital, Mirren reflected on the secret behind her strong rapport with the two actors.

""You don't develop chemistry. It's there or it isn't, you know,"" she explained. ""It just totally depends on what sort of person they are, what sort of person you are.""
""And they are two really, really great guys,"" Mirren continued. ""I think it also comes from respect, you know, professional respect and respect for the character of the other or maybe love for the character of the other person. And both Harrison and Pierce share a sort of commitment to their craft — professionalism, generosity on set. There's no sort of, 'Oh, I'm a big movie star' thing going on at all. They're both great guys.""
Prior to filming ""1923,"" Mirren had co-starred alongside Ford in the 1986 movie ""The Mosquito Coast."" In a December 2022 interview with the U.K. newspaper the Times, Mirren explained why their working dynamic on the ""1923"" set was ""very different"" from the first time that they had teamed up.

""Now our relationship is very different because I've sort of caught up with him,"" she added. ""Well, I'll never catch up with him completely, but I'm a little bit closer than I was.""
Brosnan and Mirren had both previously appeared in the 1980 British gangster movie ""The Long Good Friday,"" which marked the future James Bond franchise star's film debut. In a recent interview with TVLine, Mirren recalled that she never met Brosnan while filming ""The Long Good Friday,"" noting that ""he played a very small role, nonspeaking role — important little role, but nonspeaking — and I was never in any scenes that he was in.""

While speaking with Fox News Digital, Mirren shared that Brosnan played a pivotal role in her decision to join the cast of ""MobLand,"" which also stars Tom Hardy.
""I was working with Pierce Brosnan on a great film called ‘The Thursday Murder Club’ that is coming out very soon but was shot before ‘Mobland,’"" she recalled. ""And we were both working together for the first time really, properly together. We both got sent the script at the same time, so we could talk to each other about it. 'Oh, Pierce, I've been sent this. I hear you've been sent it. Yeah, what do you think about it?' 'Well, I don't know. What do you about it?'""

""So, a lot of those sort of conversations went on,"" Mirren continued. ""But the fact that Pierce was going to be in it was hugely influential on my decision.""
""He's the nicest, best, most professional, great guy,"" she added. ""And, and at my point in life, the people I work with have become really very, very important.""
Mirren said Hardy's involvement in ""MobLand"" was also a factor in her choice to sign on for the series.

On ""Mobland,"" set in modern-day London, Mirren and Brosnan play the matriarch and patriarch of the powerful Harrigan crime family, while Hardy portrays their ""fixer,"" Harry Da Souza.

During her interview with Fox News Digital, Mirren raved about playing the ruthless character of Maeve.
""I love Maeve,"" she said with a laugh. ""I love Maeve. Oh, my God, I'm having such a good time playing her. I was saying to someone just now, it's like a very beautifully made comfortable coat or dress or something that I adore putting on, and I just feel great in it. And that's what Maeve is like.""
""Mobland"" is streaming on Paramount+ with new episodes released weekly on Sundays.

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, took the stand Tuesday to testify against the former bad boy of music in his federal trial for sex crimes.
The model, who is pregnant with her third child with husband Alex Fine, was the only witness prosecutors called to the stand during the second day of proceedings at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in Manhattan.
Throughout nearly eight hours of questioning, Ventura recalled harrowing experiences from her 12-year relationship with the ""I'll Be Missing You"" singer, many of which she said occurred under the pressure of Diddy's sexual gratification.

Ventura testified to using drugs, including ketamine and cocaine, as a way to disassociate during the ""freak offs.""
""For me, it was dissociative … I couldn’t imagine doing that without some sort of buffer,"" she told Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Johnson. ""I needed to remain high to stay present with the experience.""
Ventura admitted that ecstasy made her feel euphoric and aroused, while ketamine would make her dissociative. Cocaine made her heart race, and mushrooms made her see things. GHB, also known as the date-rape drug, made her feel drunk.

While on the stand, she recalled one instance when there was a blow-up pool they had filled with oil. She explained she got in because ""you couldn’t say no."" Ventura was concerned about Diddy's temper if she didn’t get in, the singer-songwriter told the prosecutor.

Ventura testified that the supplies for the ""freak offs"" – baby oil, Astroglide, lubricants and condoms – were provided by Diddy’s assistants or security.
All participants in the ""freak offs"" used baby oil, according to Ventura. She claimed it was always heated, per Diddy’s request. Baby oil was used so they were ""glistening,"" she said. Diddy allegedly had them apply the oil every five minutes.

""If he felt you were too dry, he would let you know … you need to be shining,"" she told the jury. Diddy would direct the ""freak offs,"" but Ventura ""knew what to do."" She testified it was ""a very choreographed experience.""
On March 25, 2024, Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami were raided in connection with a federal human trafficking investigation, officials confirmed to Fox News Digital at the time. During the search, authorities allegedly seized various ""freak off"" supplies, including narcotics and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.
""Members and associates of the Combs Enterprise, including high-ranking supervisors, security staff, household staff, personal assistants, and other Combs Business employees, facilitated the Freak Offs by, among other things, booking hotel rooms for the Freak Offs; stocking the hotel rooms in advance with the required Freak Off supplies, including controlled substances, baby oil, lubricant, extra linens, and lighting,"" the indictment claimed.

The associates also cleaned hotel rooms after the ""freak offs"" to ""try to mitigate room damage""; arranged the travel for victims, commercial sex workers and Combs to and from the ""freak offs""; and were responsible for ""resupplying Combs with requested supplies."" The team members allegedly delivered large sums of cash to Combs to pay the commercial sex workers and would also schedule the delivery of IV fluids.
Ventura filed a sexual abuse suit against Diddy in November 2023, which was settled one day later. (Getty Images)
""Freak offs"" were ""elaborate produced sex performances that Combs arranged, directed, masturbated during, and often electronically recorded,"" according to the indictment.
Combs and his staff allegedly transported commercial sex workers across state lines and internationally for the ""freak offs,"" which regularly occurred and sometimes lasted multiple days, often including multiple sex workers.
Ventura testified that the sessions would sometimes last days at a time.
""The ‘freak offs’ became a job. There was no space for anything else but to recover,"" she said on the stand.

Ventura recorded hundreds of songs during their relationship, but only some of the music was released. She said when she wasn't working on music, she was ""recovering.""
The ""freak offs"" would last between 24 and 72 hours. Ventura recalled the longest ""freak off"" was four days. When she wasn't participating, she was recovering from ""the drugs, dehydration, staying awake,"" she said.
""Every ‘freak off’ was directed by Sean,"" Ventura testified, which included her positioning, the lighting, etc. Eventually, Ventura and a male escort were instructed to put baby oil on each other.
Ventura claimed on the stand that the ""Victory"" singer requested to be called by her grandfather's nickname.
""It was weird,"" she told the courtroom after the jury was shown an email between the former couple, which was sent from ""baby girl"" (Ventura) to ""Pop Pop"" (Diddy). The subject line read, ""I really need to f---.""  Diddy replied, asking who she planned to sleep with. Ventura testified she sent the email ""because I wanted to be with him,"" referring to Combs.

Ventura claimed she wanted to have sex with Diddy, not the escorts, during their relationship.
Diddy told Ventura about his ""fantasy"" of seeing her with another man during the first year of their relationship.
The musician was in her early 20s when she began a romantic relationship with Diddy after meeting the rapper in 2006. In addition to his interest in voyeurism, Diddy also allegedly introduced Ventura to swinging: the act of switching partners with another couple.
Ventura testified she was ""shocked"" and ""didn’t know how to react"" to Combs’ fantasy. At this point, Diddy had allegedly been violent with Ventura. She said she was afraid of upsetting him and ""really nervous.""

Diddy was charged with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution in a federal indictment unsealed Sept. 17.
Authorities allege Diddy ran a criminal enterprise through his businesses, including Bad Boy Entertainment, Combs Enterprises and Combs Global, among others. He used ""firearms, threats of violence, coercion and verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse"" to fulfill his sexual desires, according to prosecutors.
He has maintained his innocence. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/george-clooney-shaken-when-biden-failed-recognize-him-star-studded-fundraiser-authors","George Clooney was 'shaken' when Biden failed to recognize him at star studded fundraiser: authors","'The Five' co-hosts discuss actor George Clooney doubling down on pulling support for former President Joe Biden as the Bidens plot their comeback.
George Clooney was allegedly left ""shaken to his core"" after an uncomfortable face-to-face with former President Biden during a star-studded fundraiser in 2024.
In an excerpt from the upcoming book, ""Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,"" authors Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson detail the ""terrifying"" moment in which the former President of the United States failed to recognize the Oscar Award-winning actor after years of knowing each other.
""It was like watching someone who was not alive,"" one insider claimed in the excerpt, which was published by The New Yorker on Tuesday. ""It was startling. And we all looked at each other. It was so awful.""
GEORGE CLOONEY PRAISES ‘EXTRAORDINARY’ BIDEN, DISCUSSES NY TIMES ESSAY THAT PRESSURED PRESIDENT TO DROP OUT

By the time the 2024 Presidential race had started, Clooney had known Biden ""well for fifteen years.""
""He had last seen Biden on December 4, 2022, when Clooney was in D.C. with his wife, Amal, to be celebrated at the Kennedy Center Honors,"" the authors wrote. ""Biden looked older, sure, but in the East Room of the White House, at the reception for the honorees, the President was playful and seemed cogent enough.""

Fast-forward to 2024, and the authors claim Clooney - who was accompanied by good friend and fellow actor Julia Roberts - immediately noticed Biden's physical decline the moment he saw him.

""The President appeared severely diminished, as if he’d aged a decade since Clooney last saw him, in December, 2022,"" they wrote. ""He was taking tiny steps, and an aide seemed to be guiding him by the arm.""
An insider who witnessed the encounter said the moment was ""uncomfortable."" (AP/Getty)
According to the book, Clooney ""felt a knot"" form in his stomach as the frail President approached him.
""Biden looked at him. ‘Thank you for being here,’ he said. ‘Thank you for being here.’""
""'You know George,' the assisting aide told the President, gently reminding him who was in front of him. ‘Yeah, yeah,’ the President said to one of the most recognizable men in the world, the host of this lucrative fund-raiser. ‘Thank you for being here.’""
The authors wrote that it ""seemed clear"" that Biden ""had not recognized Clooney.""

""It was not O.K.,"" an insider, who had witnessed the moment, told the authors, per the excerpt. ""That thing, the moment where you recognize someone you know —especially a famous person who’s doing a f---ing fundraiser for you — it was delayed. It was uncomfortable.""
""Clooney was shaken to his core. The President hadn’t recognized him, a man he had known for years. Clooney had expressed concern about Biden’s health before—a White House aide had told him a few months before that they were working on getting the President to take longer steps when he walked—but obviously the problem went far beyond his gait. This was much graver.""
Clooney has been open about his thoughts on Biden's alleged mental decline.  (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)
Biden was showing signs of ""obvious brain freezes and clear signs of a mental slide.""
""It was, to some of them, terrifying,"" the authors wrote.
Representatives for Clooney, Biden, Tapper and Thompson did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
Clooney called on Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election in a New York Times guest essay published in July 2024, arguing that his disastrous debate performance against former President Trump proved he’s too old to win a second term.
""This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president,"" the actor wrote. He also stated in the piece that he noticed Biden’s frailty during a Hollywood fundraiser for his campaign in June.
The actor wrote an op-ed piece for The New York Times in July, calling for Biden to drop out of the Presidential race.  (Photo by Bruce Glikas/WireImage)
""It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,"" Clooney wrote.
In March, Clooney defended his decision to write the op-ed.
""I was raised to tell the truth,"" Clooney, the son of a journalist, said when asked about the essay on ""60 Minutes"". ""I had seen the president up close for his fundraiser, and I was surprised, and so I feel as if there were a lot of profiles in cowardice in my party through all of that. And I was not proud of that, and I also believed I had to tell the truth.""

Salma Hayek is not showing signs of slowing down.
The 58-year-old Mexican American actress graces the latest cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, posing in a green bikini, although she admits that she had doubts about going through with the photo shoot.
""I said yes and then when it was time to do it, I tried to back out,"" Hayek told the ""Today"" show. ""I said, 'No,' because the bathing suits never fit me, how am I gonna do this? There's nothing my size — I always suffer.'""

As Hayek revealed she had a ""very bad case of impostor syndrome,"" she continued to reflect on how she never imagined she would appear on the cover.
""I still can't believe it,"" Hayek added. ""I remember when I was young and hot, I used to look at this magazine. I wanted to see who was the new gorgeous model, the new girl of the moment. And it never crossed my mind that I could be on that cover because they didn't look like me. My body's not necessarily the model type and I never thought that was a possibility. And for it to happen when I'm 58? It's really shocking.""
She expressed similar sentiments in her interview with the outlet itself, saying, ""I remember when I was young, a long, long time ago, I was always excited to see the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated, and [thinking] ‘Who’s going to be in it?’ Of course, I didn’t look like a model, so it never crossed my mind that one day I would be in it.""

""If somebody had told me I was gonna be in it at 58, I would have sent them to the madhouse, but the world has changed, and that’s exciting.""
Hayek continued, ""I feel so fortunate that I am part of a generation that has been able to really experience very tangible change. I could retire, but I don’t want to miss out on this time. I fought for it, you know, and I’ve been part of it, and I think it's really remarkable that a magazine like Sports Illustrated [Swimsuit] says that it’s O.K., maybe even cool, to be past 50 and still be able to feel not just sexy, but for me, to be free and not be self-conscious of your body like you have to hide.""SALMA HAYEK FEELS ‘PRESSURE’ TO MAKE MONEY DESPITE MARRIAGE TO BILLIONAIRE

(Video credit: AP)
Nearly nine years have passed since Kim Kardashian was allegedly attacked and held at gunpoint in her Paris hotel room while intruders stole millions of dollars worth of jewelry. Now, the SKIMS founder is set to face the alleged gunmen during her testimony in a Paris courtroom on Tuesday.
While in court on Tuesday, Kardashian, 44, said the robbery marked what she thought would be the last day of her life.
""I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,"" she said during her testimony on Tuesday. ""I absolutely did think I was going to die.""
Kardashian, who thanked the French authorities for ""allowing me to share my truth,"" told the court she recalled screaming to the robbers at the time of the intrusion, ""I have babies.""

""[Kim] has tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system and has been treated with great respect by the French authorities,"" Kardashian's attorney, Michael Rhodes, said in a statement to Fox News Digital ahead of the trial. ""She wishes for the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.""
The mom of four, who was accompanied by her mom Kris Jenner on Tuesday, is testifying against a group known as the ""grandpa robbers"" due to their age. More than 17 people were arrested as suspects in connection to the case after investigators found trace amounts of DNA on plastic bands tied around Kardashian's wrists. The case was finally ordered to go on trial in 2021 with 12 people charged.

""It was the scariest thing I’ve ever been through in my entire life.""
Ten people are being tried, with five facing armed robbery and kidnapping charges. The other suspects are charged with being accomplices to the heist or unauthorized possession of a weapon, according to Reuters.
""It was the scariest thing I’ve ever been through in my entire life,"" Kardashian said during an episode of ""Felony Files"" in 2019. ""Just thinking that, you know, you’re about to die. … You’re bracing yourself for the moment they’re going to shoot you and kill you. That 10 minutes really changed my whole life. ""

On Oct. 3, 2016, the intruders allegedly disguised themselves as police officers with ski masks as they broke into her room at the No Address Hotel, tied up the reality star and placed her in the bathtub while they stole various jewelry pieces, including her $4 million engagement ring from then-husband Kanye West.
Kardashian, who was in town for Fashion Week with her sisters, Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner, and mother Kris Jenner, had posted on social media that she was home alone while her family went out to explore Paris.

""I was Snapchatting that I was home and that everyone was going out,"" Kim said on a 2017 episode of ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians.""
While lying in bed, Kardashian heard footsteps approaching her door and, after calling out for her sisters, she realized something was wrong.

""Then at that moment when there wasn’t an answer, my heart started to get really tense,"" Kardashian said in a confessional during the episode. ""Like your stomach just kind of knots up, and you’re like, ‘OK, what’s going on? What’s going on?’ I knew something wasn’t quite right.’""
""They dragged me out onto the hallway on top of the stairs. That's when I saw the gun clear, like clear as day. I was kind of looking at the gun, looking down back at the stairs.""

""Am I going to run down the stairs and either be shot in the back? It makes me so upset to think about it,"" she said. ""Either they're going to shoot me in the back, or if I make it, and they don't, if the elevator does not open in time, or the stairs are locked, then like I'm f----d. There's no way out.""
During an appearance on ""My Next Guest Needs No Introduction"" with David Letterman in 2020, Kardashian said she mentally ""prepared"" herself for the worst.

""He grabbed me and pulled me towards him,"" Kardashian said of her attacker. ""But I wasn’t wearing anything underneath [my robe], so I was like, ‘OK, this is the time, I’m going to get raped, like, just deal, it’s going to happen, like, just prepare yourself.’ So I did, and then – I don’t know why I’m crying, I’ve talked about this before – but then he tied me up with handcuffs and zip ties, and then duct tape, and then duct-taped my mouth and my eyes.""
""You know, [the robbery has] changed the way we live our lives and just the way we take care of our kids and our grandchildren. So it’s been a process.""
""I saw he found my whole jewelry box and held it up, like, ‘Aha!’ You know, like, ‘We got it.’ But I kept on looking at the concierge [who’d been forced to unlock her door at gunpoint] because I didn’t know who he was, and I’m like, ‘What is happening? Are we going to die? Just tell them I have children, I have babies, I have a husband, I have a family, like I have to get home! Tell them to take anything. I’ll never say I saw them, like, take everything!’""
The aftermath of the robbery was difficult, but talking about it proved to be ""therapeutic"" for Kardashian.
""When we started filming again and getting up and running, you know, obviously, Kim was around because we all practically live together on the street,"" mom Kris Jenner told Ellen DeGeneres in 2017. ""And we started filming and what was coming out of that was very therapeutic for her, I think, to just explain to us and walk us through.""

""She just thinks that it might bring some awareness,"" she continued. ""You know, it’s changed the way we live our lives and just the way we take care of our kids and our grandchildren. So it’s been a process.""
Kardashian didn't return to Paris for nearly two years after the alleged attack.
""I have so many special memories in Paris,"" she said during an episode of her show in 2018. ""I hope that this trip will just be so good that I can start to remember all the magical things about Paris and why Kanye and I fell in love with it.""
In 2017, Kardashian told DeGeneres that she believes the robbery happened to ""teach"" her something.
""I know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,"" she told the daytime talk show host. ""I am such a different person. … I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things, and this was like – it was probably no secret, you see it on the show, us being flashy, I was definitely materialistic before. Not that there’s anything bad with having things and working hard to get those things, and I’m really proud of everyone around me that’s successful. But I’m so happy that my kids get this me and that this is how I’m raising my kids, because I just don’t care about that stuff anymore.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rapper-tory-lanez-stabbed-14-times-prison-attack-while-serving-megan-thee-stallion-shooting","Rapper Tory Lanez stabbed 14 times in prison attack while serving for Megan Thee Stallion shooting","Tory Lanez's father, Sonstar Peterson, told the crowd at a press conference that the rapper, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, is ""recovering remarkably"" following prison stabbing.
Rapper Tory Lanez was hospitalized after an attack Monday at a California prison where he's serving a 10-year sentence for shooting hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion in the feet, authorities said.
Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, was attacked at a housing unit at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi, at about 7:20 a.m., Pedro Calderon Michel, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said in an email.
Michel did not specify how Lanez was attacked, but a message posted on the rapper's Instagram account Monday evening said Lanez was stabbed 14 times and both his lungs collapsed. The post said Lanez is breathing on his own.
MEGAN THEE STALLION SHOOTER TORY LANEZ SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS IN PRISON
""Despite being in pain, he is talking normally, in good spirits, and deeply thankful to God that he is pulling through,"" the post said, adding Lanez was stabbed in his back, torso, head and face.
Staff immediately gave Lanez medical aid and called 911, and he was taken to an outside hospital, Michel said. The prison's investigative unit and the Kern County District Attorney's Office are investigating, he said.
The prison is about 100 miles north of Los Angeles in the mountains of the Mojave Desert and houses about 1,700 medium- and maximum-security inmates.

In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.
Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner’s Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding.

She had bullet fragments in both feet that had to be surgically removed. It wasn't until months after the incident that she publicly identified Lanez as the person who had fired the gun.
A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez’s lawyers, who are appealing his conviction. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Megan recently alleged that Lanez was harassing her from prison through surrogates, and in January a judge issued a protective order through 2030 ordering him to stop any such harassment or any other contact.
The 32-year-old Canadian Lanez began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major label albums, two of which reached the top 10 on Billboard's charts.
The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience.

The often dramatic trial was packed with friends and family members of Lanez who felt he was a victim of both the justice system and the powerful people around Megan, who is managed by Jay-Z's Roc Nation.
When the verdict was announced, Lanez's father, Sonstar Peterson, jumped up and angrily denounced prosecutors and the system before he was dragged from the chaotic courtroom where many in the audience were shouting similar things. He later apologized to the judge.
Megan Thee Stallion, 30, was already a major rising star at the time of the shooting, and her music’s popularity has soared since. She won a Grammy for best new artist in 2021, and she had No. 1 singles with ""Savage,"" featuring Beyoncé, and as a guest on Cardi B’s ""WAP.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sylvester-stallone-richard-gere-almost-brawled-over-princess-diana-elton-johns-party-author","Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere almost brawled over Princess Diana at Elton John’s party: author","Anne Allan has written a new book, ""Dancing with Diana: A Memoir,"" about her friendship with the late Princess of Wales. They worked together from 1981 to 1989.
There was a clash of the titans over the People’s Princess.
Princess Diana not only captivated the public, but she apparently made Hollywood heavyweights weak in the knees. In his new book, ""Dianaworld: An Obsession,"" author Edward White explores how the late Princess of Wales not only rocked the monarchy but also impacted pop culture decades after her death in 1997 at age 36.
One story White shared in his book about the ""Diana Effect"" claims Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere nearly went toe-to-toe over the British royal at Elton John’s house in the '90s. The account in the book came from John’s husband, David Furnish.

Fox News Digital reached out to Stallone, 78, and Gere, 75, for comment. When a fan previously asked Stallone about the alleged incident in an old Instagram post, the actor responded, ""Complete fabrication,"" Biography.com reported.
""It’s a story that [also] comes from Elton’s autobiography,"" White told Fox News Digital. ""He invited Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere to a house party that Diana was also at. I mean, it’s Elton John, so probably everyone in the room was like an A-list celebrity or a member of some grand European royal family.""
""So they turned up,"" White shared. ""According to Elton John, Sylvester Stallone turned up with the intention of picking up Diana, which is wishful thinking in several ways… But he did that.""

""Sylvester Stallone walked in and saw Diana in deep conversation with Richard Gere,"" White claimed. ""He felt that Stallone got angrier and angrier as the evening wore on, because Richard Gere was just dominating. That’s how he felt – that he was dominating the conversation with Diana.""

""At some point, from what Elton John says, Sylvester Stallone’s emotions got the better of him,"" White continued. ""He then squared up to Richard Gere, and they had to be separated… It was these two alpha males squabbling over a woman who neither probably had a chance with, to be honest.""

""As the rest of us chatted, I couldn't help but notice a strange atmosphere in the room,"" John recalled, as quoted by Biography.com.
""Judging by the kind of looks he kept shooting them, Diana and Richard Gere's newly blossoming friendship was not going down well with Sylvester Stallone at all. I think he may have turned up to the party with the express intention of picking Diana up, only to find his plans for the evening ruined.""

According to John, the guests headed over to the dining room to eat. However, Gere and Stallone were noticeably missing. John said he then sent Furnish to find the men.
""He came back with both of them, but he was wearing a fairly ashen expression,"" John wrote, noting that Furnish said there was ""a situation.""

""It transpired that he’d discovered Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere in the corridor, squaring up to each other, apparently about to settle their differences over Diana by having a fistfight,"" wrote John, as quoted by the outlet.

According to Edward’s book, Baring described that, during a lunch in London, Stallone ""really, really wanted to come and sit next to the Princess of Wales.""
""We didn’t let him do that, but we did let him sit next to a child who was sitting next to the Princess of Wales,"" said Baring, as quoted by White’s book.

""Baring remembered the occasion because she thought Diana hit upon an effective way of placating the film star, making the child feel included, and indulging her own desire to find out the latest gossip, by leaning over and asking Stallone questions about his love life as though she were asking them on Tracy’s behalf: ‘Tracy and I want to know if you’re married,’"" wrote White.

""There are these stories of royals slipping out among the commoners in disguise, and they have this magical experience because they’re living just like one of us,"" White told Fox News Digital.  ""By dressing up in male drag and going out, she felt embraced by a marginalized community. She felt an affinity with them because, rightly or wrongly, she felt like an outsider, and they were very accepting of her.""
According to ""Dianaworld,"" Princess Diana snuck into a gay bar with the help of Freddie Mercury of Queen. (Pete Still/Redferns/Getty Images)
""I also think she took huge pleasure in taking risks,"" White continued. ""It was a huge part of her identity that came back time and time again as I was researching the book. She just took the most incredibly audacious risks. She didn’t stop to think twice about things very often… But I think she also felt that she was a rolling stone without a real home. And I also think she felt like she wasn’t living life properly unless she was taking risks.""
""You could argue that getting engaged to Prince Charles at age 19, having only met him a few times and not really knowing very much about what was expected of her, was a pretty gigantic gamble,"" said White. ""Maybe one that didn’t pay off.""

In his book, White cited the memoirs of Cleo Rocos, who claimed she spent an evening with Mercury, Diana and Kenny Everett after the princess persuaded her to take her to the Royal Vauxhall Tavern. Everett warned the princess that the venue was ""not for you… full of hairy gay men.""

""Diana was insistent, however, so Everett helped her disguise herself in male drag: a camouflage army jacket, hair tucked up into a leather cap and dark aviator sunglasses,"" Rocos recalled, as quoted by White’s book.
""It was in the guise of a different person that, for at least one night, she could discover herself,"" Edward White wrote. (Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images)
""Scrutinizing her in the half-light, we decided that the most famous icon of the modern world might just…. JUST pass for a rather eccentrically dressed gay male model.""
White wrote that the disguise worked.
According to reports, Princess Diana was never caught. (David Levenson/Getty Images)
""It was fabulously outrageous and so bizarrely exciting… no one, absolutely no one, recognized Diana.""
White wrote that the group reportedly stayed for one drink and left. Diana quietly returned to Kensington Palace and sent back Everett’s clothes the next day.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/inside-diddy-jury-room-look-whos-deciding-rappers-fate","Inside the Diddy jury room: A look at who’s deciding the rapper's fate","Finney describes himself as a close friend of the 55 year-old hip hop mogul who has pleaded not guilty to charges including sex trafficking, and transporting to engage in prostitution.
Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' federal trial began Monday after a jury of eight men and four women was seated.
The 12-person jury and six alternates was only finalized minutes before opening statements began in the disgraced music mogul's sex crimes case. Diddy's legal team was concerned about jurors getting cold feet over the weekend, and Judge Arun Subramanian agreed.
Jurors, who range in age from 24 to 74, were questioned during the weeklong voir dire process about Mike Myers, beliefs regarding infidelity and their taste in music as the defense and prosecution narrowed down the potential pool to 12.

Juror No. 2 is a massage therapist and actor from Manhattan. During the voir dire, the judge asked if he recognized any names from a ""people and places"" list. The juror noted ""Michael B. Jordan"" stood out as a recognized actor.
In addition, Juror No. 2 had some familiarity with domestic violence and indicated his sister was a victim of assault, but that his experience wouldn't interfere with his ability to be impartial.

Juror No. 5, an investment analyst from Manhattan County, learned about the case from news media reporting and admitted to viewing the Cassie Ventura hotel assault video footage.
Another juror seated, Juror No. 25, is a 61-year-old scientist and freelance graphic designer who was looking forward to getting a break from his ""serious work."" Juror No. 25 knew about Diddy as a ""business person"" and was aware of ""violent behavior."" He admitted to seeing the hallway video at the gym but had not formed an opinion about what he had seen.

Juror No. 28, a 30-year-old woman from the Bronx who works as a deli clerk, noted that she gets news by word of mouth and doesn't read magazines or papers. She was aware that Diddy was arrested but didn't know why until recently and would be able to follow instructions.
Multiple Bronx residents were picked to sit on the jury. Juror No. 58, a 41-year-old man who works as the head account clerk in corrections, said he enjoys '90s hip-hop and sports. Juror No. 184, a 39-year-old male, lives with his brother and is employed as a social worker program supervisor.
The youngest juror selected at 24 years old, Juror No. 321, works in coffee services and prefers reading news through social media.
Juror No. 55 was once ticketed for an open container and accidentally marked the wrong box indicating she knew about the allegations. When Subramanian heard about her prior ticket, he joked, ""Well, shame on you.""

Juror No. 75 retired from J.P. Morgan and lives in Westchester. He watches both Fox and CNN and prefers the Discovery Channel. A 43-year-old female who was also from Westchester was seated as Juror No. 160. Her husband is a software developer, while she works as a physician's assistant.
Juror No. 116 said he would have a difficult time remaining impartial when looking at violence. While he previously viewed the Ventura  hotel footage, he mentioned having a difficult time watching videos of skateboarders falling but thinks he can handle the videos.

Both Juror No. 201, a 67-year-old man, and Juror No. 230, a 57-year-old man, have children and reside in Westchester County. Juror No. 234, a 34-year-old man who lives with his parents and sister in Manhattan, doesn't watch the news and prefers reading video game magazines.
Juror No. 247 loves to read and surf. The 40-year-old man from New York County is a physician scientist and has a master's degree and bachelor's degree in chemistry. Juror 292 mentioned she knew one location noted in the voir dire.

The final juror selected in Diddy's sex crimes case was Juror No. 330, a 37-year-old man from New York County who works with the U.S. State Department and prefers watching ""Andor"" with his girlfriend, who works in the medical field.
For the voir dire process, the jurors were given a list of people and places and asked to note if they recognized any.
Comedian Mike Myers, Diddy's children – Justin and Christian Combs – Aubrey O'Day, actress Lauren London, actor Michael B. Jordan, musician Kid Cudi, Kanye West, singer Michelle Williams, Dawn Richards and Diddy's ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, were among the names recognized by some of the potential jurors.

While it's unclear why some of the celebrities made this list, USA Today reported there is a scene in Myers' ""Austin Powers"" that jokes about the disgraced rapper.
Diddy has been charged with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution in a federal indictment unsealed Sept. 17. He has maintained his innocence. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Authorities allege Diddy ran a criminal enterprise through his businesses, including Bad Boy Entertainment, Combs Enterprises and Combs Global, among others. He used ""firearms, threats of violence, coercion and verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse"" to fulfill his sexual desires, according to prosecutors.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nicole-eggert-says-baywatch-hurt-her-dating-life","Nicole Eggert says 'Baywatch' hurt her dating life","""Baywatch"" actress Nicole Eggert reflects on the differences between '90s fame and celebrity life today.
Life wasn't always sunshine and rainbows when Nicole Eggert joined ""Baywatch"" as Roberta ""Summer"" Quinn in 1992.
On the most recent episode of the ""Still Here Hollywood"" podcast, Eggert opened up about her experience on the hit show.
Eggert joined ""Baywatch"" for season 3, but she was originally meant to appear in a spin-off of the show that had a ""'90210'-esque feel at the beach.
Nicole Eggert was pegged as a ""Baywatch bimbo"" after appearing on the hit show. (Getty Images)
The spin-off was meant to be ""a high school at the beach training to be lifeguards,"" but ""Baywatch"" became so popular, the second series was never created, Eggert revealed.
'BAYWATCH' ACTRESS NICOLE EGGERT DISCLOSES 'ROUGH' CANCER DIAGNOSIS: 'WHO'S GOING TO COVER THE BILLS'
""And they were like, ‘Spin-off nothing. This is what's working, and we want it to stay like this,'"" she said.
Eggert ""politely bowed out"" of ""Baywatch"" after two seasons because it wasn't what she signed up for.
""I had some crazy idea in my head that if I left the show, I would be able to detach myself from the stigma that the show had given all of us as actors, which is not a thing.""
""I had some crazy idea in my head that if I left the show, I would be able to detach myself from the stigma that the show had given all of us as actors, which is not a thing,"" Eggert said.
The ""Baywatch"" stigma translated into her dating life, too.

""People have an idea of who you are, and that could be a number of things. And I think it's harder for people to get to know you without this preconceived notion that they have going in,"" Eggert said.
Nicole said she's ""not like anyone"" she's played onscreen, which has thrown people off in her dating life.
Steve Kmetko, the host of the ""Still Here Hollywood"" podcast, asked Eggert what it was like being on the biggest television show in the world.

""Weird,"" Eggert simply admitted. ""We were being ripped apart in the press."" Due to the negative press, ""the casting doors were not opening anymore,"" according to the actress.
""And then all of a sudden it was like we were called ‘Baywatch bimbos’ and these dumb bimbos on the beach, and it's T&A.

""And then on the other hand, you have this No. 1 hit on your hand, and it's like what a kerfuffle. What a mess,"" Eggert admitted.

After Eggert stepped away from the hit series, she returned to the ""Baywatch"" universe in 2003 for ""Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding.""
Eggert told People magazine in 2024 that she didn't know what she was signing up for when agreeing to join the ""Baywatch"" world.
""Oh my God, we’re going to be in a bathing suit all day every day?"" she remembered thinking on day 1.
""All the girls worked out and were super tiny and fit, and I was like, ‘Whoops.’ And the one-piece bathing suits were not flattering. I didn’t want to wear it at all,"" she said of the iconic red swimsuit. ""It just wasn’t what I signed up for. It was a totally different show and ballgame and not where I wanted to be.""

While on break from shooting ""Baywatch,"" Eggert, then 18, decided to go under the knife. ""I regret it now, of course,"" she explained of getting breast implants.
""I look at all these younger girls doing it and think, ‘God, leave your bodies alone!’ But when you have to put on that one-piece, and it's like you're so flat that it's like pleating, you got pleats across the front ... you're like, ‘What is this?’ Nothing you can do. You can't stuff it with anything. You can't do anything.""
With time, Eggert started to question why she'd really gone through with the procedure. ""It was a stupid 18-year-old decision,"" she admitted to People.
Since getting the initial implants, Eggert has had several breast augmentation surgeries. In 2015, she appeared on an episode of ""Botched,"" wanting a breast reduction.

Eggert first felt pain in her breast and gained 25 pounds within three months. Believing them to be symptoms of menopause, she was surprised to locate a lump during a self-exam in October 2023.
""It really was throbbing and hurting,"" she previously told People. ""I immediately went to my general practitioner, and she told me I had to immediately go get it looked at. But the problem was, I just couldn't get an appointment. Everything was booked. So I had to wait until the end of November to get it done.""

Results later showed that she had stage 2 cribriform carcinoma breast cancer. Both of Eggert's parents had cancer.

Alice in Chains has canceled their tour after receiving unfortunate medical news.
The band announced their decision to call off their highly anticipated upcoming tour on social media on Saturday, due to the medical advice they received regarding drummer Sean Kinney's health.
""After careful consideration and following the advice of medical professionals, we have made the decision to cancel our remaining upcoming festival performances and the Alice in Chains headline shows,"" the band's statement read. ""While we were all eager to return to the stage, Sean's health is our top priority at this moment.""

News of the cancellation comes shortly after the band canceled their concert at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Montville, Connecticut on May 8, after Kinney ""experienced a non-life-threatening medical emergency"" during the soundcheck.
Had the group not canceled the show in Connecticut, it would have been the first time they performed on stage together in over a year, as their last show together was at the Sick New World festival in Las Vegas in April 2024.
In addition to canceling their tour, they also canceled upcoming performances in Nashville and Atlanta, as well as appearances at various music festivals, including MMR*B*Q, Sonic Temple and Welcome to Rockville. As of now, their only scheduled performance is during Black Sabbath's final concert in the United Kingdom in July, according to the band's website.
Alice in Chains was formed in Seattle in 1987, with Kinney playing the drums alongside bandmates Jerry Cantrell, Mike Starr and Layne Staley. Current band members, Mike Inez and William DuVall joined later, taking the place of Starr and Staley.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tom-cruise-shuts-down-trump-movie-tariff-question-while-promoting-mission-impossible","Tom Cruise shuts down Trump movie tariff question while promoting 'Mission: Impossible'","Freddy Bouciegues, a stunt coordinator in Hollywood, has high praise for Tom Cruise, but points out actors still need stunt doubles for safety.
Tom Cruise is keeping mum on President Donald Trump's idea of imposing a tariff on all movies made outside the U.S.
The actor appeared at an event in South Korea to promote his upcoming movie, ""Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning."" Cruise was speaking at a Q&A panel with the movie's director, Christopher McQuarrie, and a few of his co-stars, when a reporter asked a question about the possible tariff.
""I'd like to ask this question to anybody who's up for it,"" the reporter, whose question was translated from Korean to English by a moderator, asked, per Entertainment Weekly. ""I watched this film and I saw that it was filmed in many different locations around the world, including Africa. Of course, we all are aware of the tariffs that President Donald Trump has been imposing on overseas productions and films. So, is this particular movie under that tariff? And how much of the film was shot overseas?""

The outlet shared that Cruise looked to McQuarrie and took a pause before telling the moderator off-mic, ""We’d rather answer questions about the movie. Thank you.""
""I think that's a fair answer,"" the moderator replied.
Cruise's reps did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
According to IMDb, ""Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning"" was filmed in London, South Africa and Norway from March 2022 to July 2023, with additional shots filmed in March 2024.

On May 4, Trump brought up the idea of a tariff that would affect movies made overseas in a post he shared on Truth Social.
""The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,"" he wrote. ""Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat.""
Trump continued, ""It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda! Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!""

The following day, White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Fox News Digital, ""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump’s directive to safeguard our country’s national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again.""
In January, Trump named actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone as his Hollywood ambassadors, and earlier this month, Voight, along with special advisor Steven Paul, submitted a ""comprehensive plan"" to the president to save the film and television industry.
Voight and Paul met with ""dozens of leading film and television organizations (guilds, unions, studios and streamers) about what changes need to be made to increase domestic film production,"" according to a statement.

The meeting was conducted in person with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida and included SP Media Group/Atlas Comics President Scott Karol.
""The proposal includes federal tax incentives, significant changes to several tax codes, the establishment of co-production treaties with foreign countries, and infrastructure subsidies for theater owners, film and television production companies, and post-production companies,"" the statement said. ""The proposal also includes a focus on job training, and tariffs in certain limited circumstances.""

""The president loves the entertainment business and this country, and he will help us make Hollywood great again,"" Voight said.
""The American film industry, and Hollywood, is a beacon for teaching the American Dream to the world and is an engine for job growth and career opportunity,"" said Paul. ""It’s essential that we preserve America’s leadership in film and television production.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/morgan-wallen-breaks-silence-snl-abrupt-exit-sparked-controversy","Morgan Wallen breaks silence on 'SNL' after abrupt exit sparked controversy","The Big Weekend Show takes a look at what some are calling an awkward exit.
Morgan Wallen was ready to go home – and he meant it.
Back on March 29, the ""I’m the Problem"" singer was the musical guest for ""Saturday Night Live"" when he abruptly left the stage during the traditional end-of-show credits segment.
Shortly after leaving Manhattan's 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Wallen wrote that he was excited to return home. The country music star shared a photo on his Instagram Stories of a private jet with the caption ""Get me to God’s country"" written over it.
On Sunday, the 31-year-old appeared on comedian Caleb Pressley’s podcast when he finally addressed his sudden exit.

""Seriously, ‘SNL,’ did they make you mad?"" the host questioned after cracking several jokes.
""No, no, I was just ready to go home,"" said Wallen. ""I've been there all week.""
During the episode, the two also poked fun at another incident that landed the star in hot water.
""Do you mind if we do a new segment presented by Food Barn, please?"" said Pressley. ""In this segment, I want you to name a thing that you can sit in that also flies through the air.""
""I mean, there's one obvious answer,"" said Wallen. ""Why do you want me to say that though? I mean, yeah, a jet.""
""There's another answer to that question as well,"" Pressley teased. ""You can sit in it, and it can also fly through the air.""
""Oh, I know the answer to that question,"" said the singer. ""A chair!""
In 2024, Wallen was sentenced to spend seven days in a DUI education center and be under supervised probation for two years after throwing a chair from the rooftop of a Nashville, Tennessee, bar. The chair nearly hit two police officers.

Regarding the ""SNL"" incident, sources previously told Fox News Digital that nothing was wrong at the show, and Wallen's walk-off appeared to be an ""oops"" moment.
""That was the way he entered and exited the studio all week during rehearsal and camera blocking, so he just walked that way after hugging [host] Mikey [Madison],"" an insider revealed.
It is customary for ""SNL"" guests to stay and congratulate the cast. In the episode, Madison thanked the ""Last Night"" singer for appearing on the show before he walked directly off the stage. Cameras then panned out to the cast congratulating each other.

During his appearance, Wallen performed two songs from his upcoming album, including ""Just in Case"" and ""I'm the Problem."" While the sudden exit sparked rumors of a disagreement between Wallen and ""SNL,"" he appeared unfazed. Instead, Morgan capitalized on the viral exit by selling merchandise with the phrase ""Get me to God’s country"" written on them.
A week after Wallen’s appearance, ""SNL"" addressed the incident in a cold-open bit, Billboard.com reported. According to the outlet, James Austin Johnson’s Donald Trump impersonation took a shot at Wallen while discussing ""Liberation Day"" tariffs.
""I even put tariffs on an island uninhabited by humans,"" said Johnson in character. ""It’s called Heard and McDonald Island. I would love to visit there. Can you imagine that? Big Mac and a hula skirt. Get me to God’s country, right? Remember that?""
Morgan Wallen went on to capitalize on the viral moment. (NBC/Getty Images)
The outlet reported that during that same April 5 episode, Colin Jost targeted the singer during a bit about the economy.
""This was the worst week for the stock market since the summer of 2020,"" he said. ""But you have to remember — back then, the president was also Trump. Just in the past two days, investors have lost over $6 trillion. Money is leaving the stock market faster than Morgan Wallen at goodnights.""
Kenan Thompson also spoke out about the unusual quickstep.

""We’re so used to everybody just turning around and high-fiving us, everybody’s saying, ‘Good job, good job, good job.’ So when there’s a departure from that, it’s like, hmm, I wonder what that’s about?"" Thompson said.
Still, the comic noted that Prince pulled a similar move during his appearance years ago.
""I’m not saying Morgan Wallen is Prince, but we weren’t surprised because Prince was notoriously kind of standoffish,"" Thompson said. ""It’s just how he was. So, we just thought like, ‘OK, now he’s gone back into fantasyland.'""
Morgan’s return to ""SNL"" was years in the making following a controversial debut.

Roughly seven months into the pandemic, Wallen was asked to be the musical guest on an October episode of ""Saturday Night Live."" Days before he was scheduled to perform, footage went viral across social media showing the singer not wearing a COVID mask at an Alabama football game and celebrating with various women at a bar afterward. People who supported masks and social distancing during the pandemic were outraged.
He was immediately removed from the scheduled ""SNL"" appearance. Wallen apologized in a video shared online.
""I'm in New York City in a hotel room, I was getting ready for 'SNL' this Saturday, and I got a call from the show letting me know that I will no longer be able to play,"" he said. ""That's because of COVID protocols, which I understand.""

After apologizing, he added, ""I think I've lost myself a little bit. I've tried to find joy in the wrong places, and it's left me with less joy. So I'mma go try to work on that. I'm gonna take a step back from the spotlight for a while and go work on myself.""
Two months later, Wallen was invited back to 30 Rockefeller Plaza for a second chance on ""Saturday Night Live."" He not only performed, but also poked fun at his bar antics while appearing in a sketch with Pete Davidson, Jason Bateman and Bowen Yang.
When the episode was over, he thanked the audience for ""giving this poor Southern boy a second Yankee chance.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/naomi-judds-widower-confirms-late-singer-shot-gun-him-after-learning-about-his-his-infidelity","Naomi Judd's widower confirms late singer shot a gun at him after learning about his infidelity","Wynonna Judd told Fox News Digital, her and her mom Naomi Judd's shared love of music helped them ""bypass the bullcrap"" and build a close relationship.
Editor's note: This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
Larry Strickland, Naomi Judd's widower, confirmed the late singer once shot a gun at him after learning about his infidelity.
In the Lifetime docuseries ""The Judd Family: Truth Be Told,"" the 79-year-old – who was married to Judd for 33 years before her death in 2022 – briefly opened up about the incident.
In a voiceover from her 1993 memoir, ""Love Can Build a Bridge,"" Judd could be heard saying that she and Strickland were ""wildly, madly, passionately in love,"" despite her husband rarely being home. At the time, Judd detailed the moment she learned about her husband's cheating after a woman continued to call their home and express her love for Strickland.

A heartbroken Judd recalled tearing up photos of the pair and throwing Strickland's clothes and belongings out.
At one point during the docuseries, Strickland rewatched a scene from the TV movie ""Love Can Build a Bridge"" in which Kathleen York, who played Naomi, shoots Bruce Greenwood, who played Strickland, after discovering his infidelities.
""Well, it really happened,"" Strickland admitted. ""That's all I can say. That's all I'm going to say. It happened.""
Judd and Strickland married in May 1989.

The Judds member died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 30, 2022, one day before she was set to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.
""I was really scared to death about her flying alone all the way from Vienna back to Nashville 'cause I knew how fragile she was,"" Strickland said of the days leading up to her death during CMT’s ""Naomi Judd: A River of Time"" honoring Naomi shortly after her death.
Naomi's daughter, actress Ashley Judd, appeared on ""Good Morning America"" at the time to discuss her mother's mental health and her manner of death.
""She used a weapon… my mother used a firearm,"" Ashley said during the appearance. ""So that’s the piece of information that we are very uncomfortable sharing, but understand that we’re in a position that if we don’t say it someone else is going to.""

Ashley also shared details from Naomi's final day.
""It was a mixed day,"" the actress explained. ""I visit with my mom and pop every day when I’m home in Tennessee, so I was at the house visiting as I am every day. Mom said to me, ‘Will you stay with me?’ and I said, ‘Of course I will.’… I went upstairs to let her know that her good friend was there and I discovered her. I have both grief and trauma from discovering her.""
NAOMI JUDD DIED FROM A SELF-INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND, DAUGHTER SAYS
Elsewhere in the documentary, Ashley and sister Wynonna Judd admitted that they had a complicated relationship with their late mother, who also dealt with her own trauma on her road to success.
The sisters opened up in the first three episodes about growing up with a young mom, the abuse they experienced from one of their mother’s exes when they were children, leaving Los Angeles behind to move home to Kentucky, and how Wynonna and Naomi found and dealt with superstardom in country music.

""I’ve loved her more than I’ve loved myself, but Mother was both in love with me and terrified of me because I represented what she didn’t know and couldn’t control,"" Wynonna said at the beginning of the docuseries.
Wynonna said she believes her mother’s suicide was partly to blame on ""generational trauma"" her mother experienced.
""One of the reasons I have decided that Mom left this world is because of trauma, generational trauma, family stuff that never got healed or fixed,"" Wynonna said in the first episode of the show.

Ashley added that their mother lived with a ""constellation of her sufferings"" that spiraled into severe depression before her death.
Strickland also admitted in the docuseries he was ""jealous as crap"" of Naomi’s success early on in her career.
Naomi wrote in her memoir that after she found out that their song ""Mama He’s Crazy"" was No. 1, Strickland stood up and walked out the door.
""I was jealous as crap of her, you know,"" he admitted, ""so we just kind of fell apart a little bit.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kelly-osbourne-got-more-s-t-weight-than-being-drug-addict-alcoholic","Kelly Osbourne ‘got more s---’ for her weight than being a drug addict, alcoholic","Ozzy Osbourne's son, Jack Osbourne, said that his father's voice is still ""spot on"" despite his physical ailments and people would be ""blown away"" by his voice.
Kelly Osbourne says she’s received more criticism over her weight than anything else she’s ever done, including drugs and alcohol.
On Saturday, the reality TV star participated in a panel at the Inaugural Beacher Vitality Happy & Healthy Summit at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles. During her appearance, the daughter of rocker Ozzy Osbourne and TV personality Sharon Osbourne opened up about the scrutiny she's endured over the years due to her physical appearance.
""We live in a fat-phobic world,"" the 40-year-old told the attendees, as quoted by People magazine.

Being body-shamed even overshadowed some of her past struggles, Osbourne insisted.
""I have been a drug addict, an alcoholic… I’ve been a complete mess, disrespectful to people, horrible – but I got more s--- for being fat than I did for anything else. It’s insane.""
Osbourne described how, when she was heavier, she often received backhanded comments.

""People [would] say, ‘You’re so pretty. Why don’t you just lose a little bit of weight, and then you’ll be the total package?’"" she said.
According to the outlet, the ""Dancing with the Stars"" alum ""tried everything"" to shed the pounds. However, it wasn’t until Osbourne addressed her mental health that she started to see results.
""I tried probably everything that there is out there, whether it be surgery, medication, diet and exercise,"" Osbourne explained. ""I got my mind where I needed it to be, and everything started to fall into place.""

""It’s not just as simple as change your diet and move,"" she said. ""You have to change your brain. You have to come to peace and acceptance about where you are in your life before you can start.""
In 2020, Osbourne told the Hollywood Raw podcast that her gastric sleeve surgery was ""the best thing I have ever done."" Still, she stressed it wasn’t an overnight solution.
""The kind of surgery I had… if you don’t work out, and you don’t eat right, you gain weight,"" said Osbourne at the time. ""All it does is move you in the right direction. So, anyone who’s thinking of doing something like this, really think about that.""

""I had to do a year of stand-alone therapy to prepare myself for the surgery before I even had it,"" she continued. ""What people don’t realize is, it cuts out this hormone that if you have addiction issues, it stops your craving, and it makes you not emotionally eat, which is a huge problem for me. It doesn’t solve all your problems. It’s not a quick fix.""
Back in 2023, Osbourne told Fox News Digital that she spent the nine months of her pregnancy in hiding with her father. She and Slipknot musician Sid Wilson welcomed their son Sidney in late 2022.
""I literally sat with my dad for nine months in a house, and I had the best pregnancy ever,"" she said at the time. ""We had a lot of fun. We really did. But there was no way I was going to go out and about and have people see me and shame me because I was so big.""

Osbourne said that while she was eager for motherhood, she was terrified of facing public scrutiny over her growing baby bump.
""I have been body-shamed since I was 14, 15 by the media,"" Osbourne explained. ""I was known as Ozzy’s chubby daughter. They’d always comment about my body and the way I looked. And I just wanted to be myself. I didn’t want to be the prettiest girl in the room, but I was penalized because I wasn’t. It’s one of those things where I am totally fine with the way that I look and am happy with myself and how I am as a person, but other people aren’t. And that’s on them. It’s not on me.""
""But people need to realize that we are responsible for our words,"" she said. ""Just because you’re behind a keyboard doesn’t make it OK. And I do think there should be more laws and rules against what people can do to another person [online]. It’s horrible.""

""Sometimes, the comments section of my social media, you just can’t look at it because just as there are many mean ones, there are nice ones, and people say really lovely things, but your mind doesn’t focus on that. You focus on the bad ones that you have. It can derail you for the entire day, week or month.""
Osbourne said she tries not to let any comments about her weight and speculation about whether she’s had any work done get to her. But some days are better than others.
""I won’t lie and say there aren’t some days when I’m just like, ‘Holy f---, that is mean,’"" she said.

In her third trimester, she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, People magazine reported. According to the outlet, she cut down on processed sugar to deal with the symptoms of weight gain, fatigue and ankle swelling.
""I hid for nine months when I was pregnant because I didn’t want what they did to Jessica Simpson when she was pregnant [to happen to me],"" said Osbourne about the star being mercilessly body-shamed.
""I think it was disgusting,"" said Osbourne. ""I still think it’s disgusting. It’s horrible, absolutely horrible. She was pregnant. What are you supposed to look like when you’re pregnant?""

""Rihanna changed the pregnancy style game in such a magical way,"" said Osbourne about the singer’s daring maternity looks during her pregnancies.
""I think what she did was incredible, but not every girl is Rihanna,"" Osbourne continued. ""I definitely felt the pressure [to lose weight after giving birth]. And I 100% caved into losing the baby weight. I’m happy I lost it, but it was because I didn’t want to be picked on.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/arnold-schwarzeneggers-son-lost-30-pounds-2-months-after-giving-up-one-thing","Arnold Schwarzenegger's son lost 30 pounds in 2 months after giving up one thing","Tom Arnold told Fox News Digital that his 11-year-old son Jax was inspired by his father's 80-pound weight loss and has been following in his footsteps.
Christopher Schwarzenegger's weight-loss transformation has been quite a journey.
While speaking at the Inaugural Beacher Vitality Happy & Healthy Summit in Los Angeles on Saturday, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver's 27-year-old son opened up about his fitness journey over the past six years.
""It was a big process,"" he said during a panel discussion with Shriver, Kelly Osbourne and the event's host, Jeff Beacher, per People. ""I started in 2019 when I was living in Australia. I was on this big trip. I made it a big [deal] like, 'Oh, I'm going to go out and do all this stuff, be in Australia,' and I just saw how much my weight was prohibiting me from doing the everyday activities.""

""I was like, 'I want to go skydiving.' And my friends were like, 'Yeah, no shot.' I was like, 'Yeah, I can't skydive,'"" he recalled.
Most recently, he decided to give up one thing during Lent that helped him lose 30 pounds within two months.
""Weirdly enough, I gave up bread for Lent,"" he said of the 40-day Christian religious observance period that precedes Easter. ""I don't know if anyone's Catholic in here, but I gave up bread for Lent.""

""I was like, 'Well, if I'm giving up bread, I might as well just take the opportunity and I'm a good Catholic boy, so I'm not going to break it,'"" he added. ""And that was my one rule. I was like, 'I'm not going to break Lent.' And so I lost 30 pounds just through that.""

Though he is on the right track, Schwarzenegger said he has not quite hit his goal.
""It's not an overnight thing, but it took a lot of trial and error,"" he said during the panel. ""And even still to this day ... when you're saying, oh, before and after photos ... I don't feel like I'm an after yet. I don't feel like I'm at the point.""

Schwarzenegger turned heads in April after being spotted out and about with his siblings for Easter.
While Schwarzenegger is rarely seen in public, he has recently been photographed at red carpet events and family outings. In 2021, Schwarzenegger first made headlines when he unveiled his weight loss while stepping out with his mom in New York City.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kyle-richards-daughter-sophia-hits-back-criticism-over-weight-loss-drug-use","Kyle Richards’ daughter Sophia hits back at criticism over weight-loss drug use","""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" star Kyle Richards praised friend and co-star Teddi Mellencamp as she battles cancer at An Unforgettable Evening Benefiting the Women’s Cancer Research Fund.
""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" star Kyle Richards' daughter, Sophia Umansky, is sharing why she decided to speak publicly about her use of the weight-loss drug Mounjaro.
""If you're honest about things, people can't even judge you or hate on you because you said it yourself,"" Umansky told People. ""You're the one that told everyone, you're owning it, so anything anyone else has to say, it's like, 'OK, well, I told you that. I'm owning it.' I think it's fine. And I always say I'm on Mounjaro. I obviously talk to a doctor.""
Mounjaro is an FDA-approved prescription drug which is commonly prescribed to people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. More recently, it has become a popular weight-loss drug, as it reduces appetite.

The reality star's daughter sparked backlash when she shared in a TikTok video that she experienced hair loss as a side effect from taking the drug, with many commenting she shouldn't be on the drug to begin with.
""People who are telling me that I don't need to be on it, they don't know what they're talking about. They're not doctors,"" she said of the backlash. ""And I think everyone needs to calm down and live their own lives. And honesty will get you far in life and lying is not fun. It's not good.""

She went on to say that her mom has always been ""very supportive of whatever decisions we make as her daughters,"" and was definitely ""trying to veer me away from getting on this medication."" However, after speaking with her doctors, Richards ""saw that that's the path I wanted to take, she was very supportive.""
""And yeah, I think a lot of people are saying that I have body dysmorphia and all this, and I'm like, 'Actually, no. I think I'm cute both ways. I think I was cute before and I'm cute now.' There's nothing wrong with trying to feel a little bit more confident, a little bit cuter,"" she added. ""People get worked on all the time, they get filler, they get Botox, they do all different kinds of things. So if I want to feel a little cuter, why not?""

In the TikTok video, Umansky explained that even running her fingers through her hair results in ""piles"" of it falling out, saying she's ""lucky that I have so much hair,"" because if she didn't she would be ""bald in about a week"" if she continued to lose it at such a rapid pace.
""People who are telling me that I don't need to be on it, they don't know what they're talking about. They're not doctors.""
Umansky has been featured on ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" a number of times throughout its 14 seasons, as her mom has been a cast member since the start of the show in 2010. The family has shared their ups and downs throughout their time on the program, most recently including Richards and her estranged husband, Mauricio Umanksy's decision to separate after 27 years of marriage.

""I’ve always said I didn’t believe in the ‘reality show curse’ because my perception was that a lot of people come into this with fractures in their marriage, and then they are looking at this as a way out. That certainly was not my story,"" Richards told The Hollywood Reporter in January 2025.
She went on to tell the outlet that she doesn't think she and Mauricio would be in this situation had their lives gone down a different path, saying, ""I definitely do believe that money and fame and all that is not great for a marriage.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/brooke-burke-swears-weird-morning-routine-powered-belly-patches-longevity-smoothies","Brooke Burke swears by 'weird' morning routine powered by belly patches, longevity smoothies","Brooke Burke told Fox News Digital she incorporates belly patches and lymphatic drainage massages into her morning routine.
Brooke Burke's ""weird"" morning routine is not for the weak, but she says it's worth it.
In a new interview with Fox News Digital, Burke broke down her detailed, three-hour health and beauty routine, which includes some unusual practices.
""This castor oil belly button detox that's popping right now on social media, I got suckered. I ordered a kit,"" Burke began.
""It's not about the castor oil. It's really about, I think, the process of connecting with the belly, heating up the core. You sleep with it, so you get this big bandage… I think personally, because it looks so weird, that's why everyone's interested.""

Burke said that after removing the patch in the morning, she will typically perform a lymphatic drainage massage on herself and rubs in the remaining oil.

""It actually works for bloating, detoxing. Skin quality is great. And I think it might be… maybe part of it's mental – you know, I'm always a skeptic and I keep it real – but it might also be the intention of kind of loving your belly a little bit and doing a belly massage and just taking care of yourself. So yeah, weird, I know, I like weird things,"" Burke laughed.
""So yeah, weird, I know, I like weird things.""
The fitness guru's longevity smoothie comes next.
""So a lot of people are asking, ‘What is longevity?’ So we're actually in a process right now of rebranding and possibly even retitling, because for the most part, longevity is a little bit more in relation to lifespan, and has some scientific components. But longevity is the superfood blend. Let's call it a superfood boost.
WATCH: Brooke Burke swears by her longevity smoothies
""It has everything in there for recovery, endurance and energy. So maca, matcha, flaxseed oils, probiotics for the tummy, sustainable energy, pea protein. So a little bit of protein, but it's not a protein powder. It's a superfood blend for anti-inflammatory,"" she explained.
Burke adds two scoops of the longevity powder to her smoothies every morning, but she also listens to her body to see what she needs every day.

""I think that a lot of women are struggling getting their protein… especially in your 40s, 50s, 60s – we have to improve our protein intake for lean muscle. To maintain the muscle that we have and certainly to build muscle, which gets harder and harder. So doing a smoothie for me, it's a two-minute meal,"" Burke said.
Some mornings, Burke will also do a cold plunge for her face. She fills up a bowl with ice water and dunks her face in it.

""So you get like a big Tupperware or a big bowl. You have to fill it with ice. It's not just cold water. Is it fun? No. Will it get rid of puffiness? Will it tighten up the skin? Yes, cold water, the skin reacts. It'll wake up your face. It literally is a cold plunge for your face and all you do is you get your hair out of the way, you stick your face in it for as long as you can. And it's pretty amazing.
""It actually works. So all of those weird things that I posted in my morning routine are things that, yes, I really do them and yes, they really work,"" Burke said with a laugh.

Another added, ""What about people that need to go to actual work and make the world go round.""

During her interview with Fox News Digital, Burke explained that she wakes up very early in the morning to get some key time for herself. She also addressed those who are skeptical of her morning routine.
""I think it is difficult. I think change is difficult. I think it is time-consuming, but the reality is you're worth it. And if you can steal an hour extra in the day by getting up early, let's go. If you can carve out two hours where you can actually set yourself up for success during the day, you will be more productive. You will be connected. You will have a greater sense of clarity,"" she said.
She added, ""I would say wake up an hour earlier. I would say yes, meditate in the morning. And that might mean that you're laying down for 10 minutes, just going through your day. You don't have to completely quiet the mind.""

Burke shared a time-hack she has been incorporating which is ""walk and talk.""
""If you can steal an hour, move in the morning, take a walk. Maybe you have a bunch of calls. You know what I've been doing lately: a walk and talk. So this has been a game changer for me,"" she said.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-middletons-royal-success-came-from-dodging-princess-dianas-missteps-author","Kate Middleton’s royal success came from dodging Princess Diana’s missteps: author","The paperback version of Andrew Morton's book, ""The Queen: Her Life,"" was recently published. The bestselling author is known as Princess Diana's biographer.
Kate Middleton has been crowned the reliable, glamorous face of a modern monarchy. Several royal experts believe that her secret to success has been playing by the rules and not breaking out as a royal rebel.
Edward White has written a new book about Kate’s late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, titled ""Dianaworld: An Obsession."" It examines the ""Diana Effect"" and how it continues to influence both the monarchy and pop culture, decades after her death at age 36.
White told Fox News Digital that, unlike Diana, who became engaged to the much older former Prince Charles when she was just 19 years old, Kate was more mature when she said ""I do"" to Prince William. Kate married the royal in 2011 when she was 29, and he was 28.

""Kate Middleton is much more reminiscent of the older generation of royal figures in the way that she comports herself,"" White explained. ""She was almost 30 when she married William, and that was deliberate from both sides. The big lesson that she probably learned from Diana’s life is don’t rush into becoming a royal.""
""Diana’s life is more reminiscent to me of a pop star’s life,"" White shared. ""She didn’t know what she was getting herself into. She was so young and very, very sheltered when she entered the royal family. Someone once said, ‘If you don’t know who you are before you’re famous, then fame is the thing that you become. It is the thing that will define who you are.’ I think that’s what happened to Diana, at least for many years.""
Edward White's book, ""Dianaworld: An Obsession,"" is out now. (W.W. Norton & Company)
Kate was not born into royal life. She’s the daughter of a flight attendant and a flight dispatcher and comes from a well-to-do area of London.

It was at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland where Kate first met William, the elder son of Charles and Diana and heir to the British throne. They were first friends and then housemates before they were romantically linked in 2004. Kate graduated in 2005 with a degree in art history and a budding relationship with William.
William complained about press intrusion, and Kate’s lawyers asked newspaper editors to leave her alone. Even so, the British media followed every twist in their relationship, including a brief split in 2007. The tabloids dubbed her ""Waity Katie"" for her patience during their courtship. William later acknowledged that the couple’s romance wobbled for several months, saying they were both young and trying to find their way.

In comparison, Diana was known as ""Shy Di"" when she found herself suddenly thrust into the glaring media spotlight. She later became an unlikely revolutionary during her years in the House of Windsor.

Diana helped modernize the monarchy by making it more personal, changing the way the royal family related to people.
By interacting more intimately with the public – kneeling to the level of children, sitting on the edge of a patient’s hospital bed, writing personal notes to her fans – she set an example that has been followed by other royals as the monarchy worked to become more human and remain relevant in the 21st century.

But Diana’s brief life was plagued with problems. She became paranoid of the palace trying to control her and cited a lack of support from senior members and the ""men in gray,"" or palace aides who prioritized tradition. Meanwhile, Charles continued seeing his mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles. Their marital woes played out on the world stage and Diana famously declared in an explosive 1995 interview with the BBC, ""There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.""

""Diana dealt with the press scrutiny in the way that she felt that she could, and in the way that she felt she had to,"" said White. ""I don’t think anybody was advising her to behave the way that she did with them. It’s an invidious position to be in. Kate Middleton handles the press scrutiny really well, but she… had to switch herself off and only focus on duty.""

""The best way of dealing with the scrutiny is by giving [the press] nothing,"" White continued. ""By stepping through the hoops of shaking hands, cutting ribbons and smiling, being dutiful and not being too big for your boots. Those are all the things that the monarchy is built on.""

British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital that Kate receives constant support from both the palace and her family – something that Diana lacked as she struggled with royal life.

""The truth is, there was an enormous amount of tension and animosity between Princess Diana and Prince Charles,"" said Chard. ""They were not a happy couple and didn’t work as a team… Princess Diana was like a rabbit thrown into the headlights. Life was hard as she didn’t have the support she craved and needed. She learned to fend for herself, grew in strength and was perceived as a rebel. She wasn’t going to allow anybody to dim her light.""

""Princess Catherine came from a supportive family, ""Chard shared. ""She also had a longer time edging her way into royal life. The most important factor is that she and Prince William are a dream team. They work together perfectly. They are each other’s rocks, plus they have an amazing extended support network. Princess Catherine has always had a strong sense of self, a quiet strength, confidence and resilience… She also knows what is expected of her as the future of the modern monarchy.""

""She navigates her role like a breeze and is the perfect future queen,"" Chard added.

Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner also agreed that William, a supportive spouse, has been essential to helping Kate navigate royal life with ease.
""Diana was strangled by royal bureaucracy, having to live with royal rules and regulations,"" he said. ""After trying everything to make Charles love her, she eventually decided to fight back.""

""I used to work with Diana during those days,"" he shared. ""I watched on many occasions when both competed with each other for the best photo opportunity. Diana always won because she was ‘The People’s Princess’ and everybody wanted to see her on public walkabouts, not Charles, which he grew to hate.""
Princess Diana easily outshined Prince Charles, which became a problem in their marriage. (Reuters)
Diana also confided in the wrong people when she wanted her voice heard, Chard argued.
In 2021, William and Harry criticized the BBC after it was revealed that one of the broadcaster’s journalists used ""deceitful behavior"" to secure Diana’s TV interview. William said the BBC’s failures contributed to the deterioration of his parents’ marriage and worsened Diana’s feelings of paranoia.

""Princess Catherine had far greater preparation and resilience than Princess Diana due in part to entering into the monarchy as an adult, well aware of the institution’s demands, and with years of support from Prince William, her family as well as the palace,"" British royals expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital.

""She’s been able to turn to her family to help her navigate both public and private challenges,"" Fordwich shared. ""She has handled the intense media scrutiny with a blend of transparency, regal dignity and composure. Even her recent public acknowledgment regarding the unfortunate photo editing controversy demonstrated accountability and leadership, shielding the royal family from any further backlash.""
""Despite intense international speculation during her illness, Princess Catherine even managed to share information on her terms, balancing public interest with personal privacy,"" Fordwich continued. ""She hasn’t played the press in the same way Princess Diana did, as Princess Catherine is far more secure in general.""

""Princess Diana sparkled, had an affinity with children, and loved her children more than anything in the world,"" said Chard. ""The same can be said of Princess Catherine.""

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' trial on sex trafficking charges will begin on Monday, a year and six months after he settled a lawsuit brought by his ex-girlfriend, accusing him of rape and abuse.
The 55-year-old rapper faces charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and transportation to engage in prostitution.
The ""I’ll Be Missing You"" singer faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty.
Here is a timeline of how he landed in the hot seat.

Diddy’s trial begins Monday in Federal District Court in Lower Manhattan as he faces sex trafficking, racketeering, fraud and prostitution charges.
During court on Friday, Judge Arun Subramanian said a pool of 45 prospective jurors will be narrowed to 12 jurors and six alternates on Monday before opening statements begin.
The trial is expected to last around eight weeks as the rapper and mogul faces the possibility of life in prison if he’s found guilty on all the charges.
Jury selection began last Monday for Diddy’s trial, with both sides questioning the potential jury pool in an effort to narrow it down to 12, with six alternates.

The potential jurors were asked everything from their beliefs about infidelity and their taste in music to their recognition of celebrities like Kanye West and Mike Myers.
On Tuesday, Judge Subramanian instructed the lawyers that jury selection would ""continue for the next few days,"" with the trial scheduled to begin May 12 with opening statements. He gave jurors instructions ""not to discuss the case or read about it. Delete news alerts. Don’t allow anyone to speak to you.""
JAMES COMEY'S DAUGHTER IS KEY TO DIDDY PROSECUTION AFTER TAKING DOWN EPSTEIN ACCOMPLICE
""Inquiring if jurors recognize certain celebrity names helps determine their exposure to media coverage or personal opinions about individuals who may be involved in the case,"" Victor Balladares with Offit Kurman told Fox News Digital. ""Familiarity with key figures could influence a juror's perspective, consciously or subconsciously. Identifying such connections ensures that selected jurors can evaluate the case based solely on the presented evidence, free from external influences.""
Diddy was arrested at a Manhattan hotel last September on sex trafficking and racketeering charges that were revealed in an unsealed indictment accusing him of coercing women into sexual performances through his business empire. Diddy has pleaded not guilty and denied all the charges against him.

His arrest came after his homes in Los Angeles and New York were raided in connection to a federal human trafficking investigation, officials confirmed to Fox News Digital at the time.
Prosecutors added two new charges against Diddy in an April 3 superseding indictment after federal prosecutors claimed the rapper engaged in sex trafficking a female victim as recently as 2024. He was accused of transferring the woman, referred to as ""Victim 2,"" along with sex workers across state lines to engage in prostitution between 2021 and 2024.
On May 17, 2024, CNN released surveillance video that showed Diddy in a towel beating his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a hallway of a Los Angeles hotel room.

Two days after the release of the video, which was shot in 2016, Diddy shared an on-camera apology in his now-deleted Instagram post, though he didn't mention Ventura by name.
""It’s so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that. I was f---ed up – I hit rock bottom – but I make no excuses,"" he said. ""My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.""
Diddy admitted, ""I was disgusted then when I did it. I’m disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab.""
""I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I’m so sorry. But I’m committed to be a better man each and every day. I’m not asking for forgiveness. I’m truly sorry.""

The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office said at the time that it wouldn’t be able to file charges against Diddy over the assault because the statute of limitations was up.
Diddy’s apology was met with skepticism from Ventura's legal team.
""Combs’ most recent statement is more about himself than the many people he has hurt,"" Meredith Firetog, a partner at Wigdor LLP, the legal firm representing Ventura, told Fox News Digital at the time.
""When Cassie and other multiple women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday. That he was only compelled to ‘apologize’ once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words,"" she added.

His lawyer, Aaron Dyer, said it was a ""gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs’ residences.""
""There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated,"" he added. ""Mr. Combs was never detained but spoke to and cooperated with authorities.""
Diddy’s ex, Cassie Ventura, who goes by Cassie as an R&B singer, filed a lawsuit against the rapper in November 2023, accusing him of subjecting her to years of abuse, beatings and rape.
The rapper settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount a day later while denying the accusations through his attorney.

Cassie claimed in the lawsuit that he raped her in her own home, and made her endure ""over a decade"" of his ""violent behavior and disturbed demands,"" including forcing her to have sex with male prostitutes while he watched and filmed.

A week later, two more women came forward accusing Diddy of sexual abuse in lawsuits.
This was followed by dozens of additional lawsuits by more women and men who accused Diddy of similar behavior. He has denied all of the allegations.

""President [Donald] Trump also announced a new trade deal with the U.K. that will reopen British markets for American companies,"" he began. ""All that Britain demands in return is that we keep these two,"" he said as a photo of Harry and Meghan flashed on the screen.
The estranged royals made their official move to Montecito, Calif., in March 2020 after deciding to take a step back from their roles, citing the intrusive British media and what they said was a lack of support from the palace.

PRINCE WILLIAM’S PUBLIC DIG AT MEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY SHOWS HE ‘DOESN’T CARE’ WHAT THEY THINK: EXPERTS
Since stepping away from their roles as working royals, the couple have made comments about their experience within the royal family, most notably during an in-depth interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, during their Netflix documentary series, ""Harry & Meghan,"" and in Prince Harry's memoir, ""Spare.""
""President Trump also announced a new trade deal with the U.K. that will reopen British markets for American companies,"" he began. ""All that Britain demands in return is that we keep these two.""
The ""Saturday Night Live"" episode comes a short time after Prince Harry told the BBC he would like to reconcile with his family.
""There’s no point in continuing to fight anymore,"" he said, adding that he doesn't ""know how much longer my father has.""
""There have been so many disagreements,"" said Harry. ""Differences between me and some of my family. … Of course, some members of my family will never forgive me for writing a book. Of course, they will never forgive me for lots of things. But … I would love a reconciliation with my family. … It would be nice to reconcile.""
Harry said it is ""entirely up to"" his family whether they want to reconnect or not.

Despite Harry's willingness to reconcile, royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital that his elder brother, Prince William, Prince of Wales, remains singularly focused on ""protecting the monarchy"" and is not keen on reconciling.
""Over the years, the gulf has widened between Prince William and Harry, all due to Harry’s ever-public denigration of the royal family, not the least of which has been this most recent BBC interview. Prince William is more resolved than ever to take action once he becomes king. His overriding concern is protecting the monarchy, which he sees as denigrated by commercial endeavors,"" she said.
Meanwhile, Harry and Markle recently attended a Beyoncé concert in Los Angeles as part of her ""Cowboy Carter"" tour.
Markle posted photos from their night out, including several photos of the couple dancing, cuddling and kissing. One of the photos showed the special words embroidered onto Prince Harry's hat, which included ""Archie,"" ""Lili"" and ""My Love.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/david-beckhams-son-brooklyn-speaks-about-his-dad-speculation-tension-family-continues","David Beckham's son, Brooklyn, speaks about his dad as speculation of 'tension' in family continues","David Beckham waved to his fans while walking the green carpet at the Earthshot Prize Awards in Boston on Friday.
David and Victoria Beckham's oldest son is commenting on his shared passion with his dad amid speculation there is ""tension"" in the family.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, which was published in May but conducted in March, Brooklyn Beckham, 26, credited his dad with inspiring his love of racing at a young age while discussing his experience at the Formula E Evo Sessions in Miami at the Miami International Autodrome.
""It’s something that me and my dad bonded over. My dad’s had some pretty cool cars,"" Beckham said, later adding he has a collection of them and that his favorite is a ""1954 Jaguar, which I very rarely drive, only when the weather’s perfect.""
Brooklyn had the opportunity to get behind the wheel of the Jaguar I-Type 7 in March when he attended the Formula E Evo Sessions, an event that gave 11 people from the world of sports, entertainment and tech the chance to drive the world's fastest electronic race car.

VICTORIA BECKHAM DEFENDS SON BROOKLYN AFTER HIS 'SUNDAY ROAST' CAUSES CONTROVERSY
The younger Beckham's comments come a week after he and his wife, Nicola Peltz-Beckham, were noticeably absent from his dad's 50th birthday celebration this month.
""It’s something that me and my dad bonded over. My dad’s had some pretty cool cars.""
Victoria posted many photos from birthday events, which featured their three younger children, Romeo, 22, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 13, captioning the post, ""Creating special memories with family and friends. We love you all."" Their absence from the event reignited rumors of a feud between the couple and his famous parents.
""There are tensions between Brooklyn and [wife] Nicola [Peltz] and the family,"" a source told People this month. ""The relationship is definitely not beyond repair. They love and are always there for him. They’re just hurt and disappointed that he’s now playing no part in family life.""
Rumors of a feud between Victoria and Nicola began shortly after she and Brooklyn Beckham tied the knot in April 2022, with many fans noticing Nicola didn't share any photos of his family on social media. Speculation was further fueled when it was revealed Peltz-Beckham didn't wear a wedding dress designed by Victoria.

In addition, while her husband attended his mom's 50th birthday party, Peltz-Beckham was noticeably absent, choosing to visit her grandmother instead. She did, however, wish her mother-in-law a happy birthday on Instagram.

Both have shot down speculation of a feud in the past.
""I’ve said this so many times: There’s no feud. I don’t know. No one ever wants to write the nice things,"" Peltz-Beckham told Cosmopolitan in March 2023. ""It’s really weird, actually, whether it’s my life or someone else’s life or whatever, when you know the truth, and then you read something totally wrong.""
The couple reportedly began dating in 2019 before officially confirming their relationship in January 2020, when they posted a mirror selfie on Instagram. Just a few months later, in June 2020, the two announced they were engaged.

When speaking about the proposal in February 2022, Brooklyn Beckham shared during an appearance on ""The Late Late Show With James Corden"" that the whole experience ""was a little bit nerve-wracking.""
""I proposed in the countryside in New York in Bedford. I filled [the gazebo] with a bunch of flowers – her favorite flower is peonies – a bunch of peonies flowers, candles, her favorite wine, some caviar,"" he said. ""I had the ring up there; it was hiding behind some flowers. It was an amazing view of this huge river.""

Wilson and Hodges, a former NFL quarterback, made their relationship known to the public in May 2023 when they walked the red carpet together at the ACM Awards. She later admitted that they had been dating for two and a half years before making their public debut.
He is my biggest fan. He high-fives me on the way in the door and he high-fives me on the way out and that’s all I can ask for.
In a video captured by News Channel 5 Nashville, Wilson can be heard saying she had a feeling he was going to propose but changed her mind after thinking, ""Man, I sure would be upset if I talked myself into this and that don’t happen.""

After years of family strife, Billy Ray Cyrus is ""reflecting"" on what truly matters most.
On Sunday, the 63-year-old ""Achy Breaky Heart"" crooner took to social media to address rumors of a family feud, praise his ex-wife Tish Cyrus for being a ""strong"" mother to their children, and admit that he's made plenty of ""mistakes"" throughout his life.
""Happy Mother's Day to all the #StrongMothers out there,"" Billy Ray began his post on Instagram. ""Here's a couple that made our family who and what we are in this photo for Sunday Callin. My Mom Ruthie…who loved Will and her mama Mary who was born with the musical gift and passed it down to all of us in the family who play music by ear…Thank God she did, because I can't read a note.

""I must also add, as I witnessed just yesterday before 60 Gold Star Family's who had lost Sons and Daughters in service of our country…Please put a prayer in for them also…or give them mine if need be. Our family can heal. We are all still here. Those families have suffered a loss that can not be replaced or changed.""
""2.) Tish Cyrus was and is the very definition of a strong mother,"" he concluded. ""Trust me, I'm the first to admit, being married to me was not easy. I'm very good at making mistakes. A very imperfect man. But thank goodness…somewhere along the line my Mama also taught me, ‘life is a series of adjustments.’ Being honest here. Since I was a kid, I had to learn that lesson the hard way. Funny how history repeats itself. Full circle.""
The post comes one day after Miley posted an Instagram story after social media users had pointed out her mother, Tish, unfollowed her earlier in the week.

The singer is also father to Christopher Cyrus with ex-wife Kristin Luckey.
After announcing his divorce from Tish in April 2022, Billy Ray got engaged to Firerose, whose real name Johanna Rosie Hodges, in August.
""Everyone knew that that relationship was over a long time ago,"" Billy Ray told People magazine of his split from Tish. ""Everybody's turning the page. It's been a lot, but everyone knew that it was time for a change.""
Billy Ray and Firerose married in October 2023. The following May, Billy Ray filed for an annulment, citing ""irreconcilable differences"" and alleged ""inappropriate marital conduct"" in documents obtained by Fox News Digital at the time.

In 2023, Tish, who has been daughter Miley's manager for years, tied the knot with actor Dominic Purcell. The wedding sparked rumors of a family feud when fans noticed her children, Noah and Braison, weren't in attendance.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bindi-irwin-undergoes-emergency-surgery-showing-signs-discomfort-pain","Bindi Irwin undergoes emergency surgery after showing signs of 'discomfort' and 'pain'","The annual day honors what Steve Irwin cherished most in his life: family, wildlife conservation and fun.
Bindi Irwin was forced to miss the annual Steve Irwin Gala due to a medical emergency.
On Saturday, her brother Robert Irwin revealed that Bindi underwent immediate surgery due to a ruptured appendix.
""She's going to be OK, but surgery – out of all the things we were ready for, that was not one of them,"" Robert told People magazine at the event in Las Vegas. ""She’s just come out the other side of endometriosis and now the appendix goes. Health is so important – it really is. Bindi has become an incredible advocate for women's health, particularly, and I think it’s really important to prioritize getting help.""
""She came to Las Vegas and was ready to come to the gala, put on a brave face in a lot of discomfort and a lot of pain and said, 'Nope, I’m just going to tough it out, I’m going to go for it,'"" he added. ""But the surgeon said, 'No, your appendix is going. That thing’s gotta come out.' Health has to come first. She’s very sad. She’s devastated that she and Mom can’t be here, but I know she’ll make a speedy recovery.""

""Khaki by day – Bellagio chic by night! Here in #LasVegas for the #SteveIrwinGala raising funds and awareness for Wildlife Warriors,"" the 26-year-old wrote on Instagram.. ""Supporting conservation and remembering Dad’s extraordinary legacy. Enormous gratitude to everyone for your support as we continue to do all that we can to protect wildlife and wild places for the future generations.""

This is not the first health scare Bindi has encountered. In 2023, the mom of one revealed an endometriosis diagnosis that also required surgery.
""My life now looks completely different than it did before I had my surgery,"" Irwin told Fox News Digital at the time. ""Over the 10 years that I was really battling with endo[metriosis] without knowing it, I would get progressively worse every week and in the end, before my surgery, I was barely able to get out of bed.""

Irwin, who described the pain she experienced as a ""stabbing feeling"" and ""really scary,"" revealed in March that she endured the painful condition for 10 years and struggled for a proper diagnosis.

On her social media post announcing the news, the 25-year-old shared that she had 37 lesions and a ""chocolate cyst"" removed from her body, and noted that the first words from her doctor during recovery were, ""‘How did you live with this much pain?’""

""And now on the other side of surgery, I mean, I'm going for daily zoo walks with my family. I'm able to go to our management meetings and check up on our animals and do the filming work that I love and play with my daughter. And it is just so wonderful. I feel like I see the world in a new way now. I'm able to actually do things again.""
""It does feel like a second chance at life,"" she added.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/wynonna-judd-wishes-bond-mom-like-music-there-lot-dysfunction","Wynonna Judd wishes bond with mom was like their music, but 'there was a lot of dysfunction'","Wynonna Judd revealed the upcoming release of the Judds' tribute album, 'A Tribute to The Judds,' reminds her ‘there is a whole generation’ who doesn't know who she is.
Editor's note: This story discusses suicide and sexual assault. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). The National Sexual Assault Hotline is 1-800-656-4673.
Wynonna and Ashley Judd admitted in a new docuseries they had a complicated relationship with their late mom, Naomi Judd, who also dealt with her own trauma on her road to success.
In the A&E docuseries ""The Judd Family: Truth Be Told,"" the sisters opened up in the first three episodes about growing up with a young mom, the abuse they experienced from one of their mother’s exes when they were children, leaving Los Angeles behind to move home to Kentucky and how Wynonna and Naomi found and dealt with superstardom in country music.
""I’ve loved her more than I’ve loved myself, but mother was both in love with me and terrified of me because I represented what she didn’t know and couldn’t control,"" Wynonna said at the beginning of the docuseries.
Wynonna said she believes her mother’s suicide was partly to blame on ""generational trauma"" her mother experienced.

""One of the reasons I have decided that Mom left this world is because of trauma, generational trauma, family stuff that never got healed or fixed,"" Wynonna said in the first episode of the show.
Growing up, Naomi Judd had a judgmental mother, her younger brother died of Hodgkin lymphoma as a child, and she was a teen mom when she gave birth to Wynonna.
Wynonna called the closeness with her mother a ""blessing and a burden"" because she felt ""responsible for making her feel better.""
""As a child, she did not get what she needed,"" Wynonna said. ""That is a fact.""
But she admitted that she was ""not allowed to be a child"" growing up.
""I was the adult,"" Wynonna said of her relationship with her mother.
Ashley added that their mother lived with a ""constellation of her sufferings"" that spiraled into severe depression before her death.
""I’ve loved her more than I’ve loved myself, but mother was both in love with me and terrified of me because I represented what she didn’t know and couldn’t control.""
Wynonna said, from a young age, Naomi was always looking for approval from her own mother, who judged her for loving an audience as a kid, which Ashley said continued into her professional music career.
""It wasn't about ego and grandiosity and self-importance,"" Ashley revealed. ""It was actually something much more humble than that. It was about basic self-worth.""

After splitting from their father, their mother met a man who Wynonna described as ""creepy,"" Ashley and Wynonna said.
""Mom had a really, really not healthy boyfriend,"" she explained. ""She saw him as James Dean. The reality was he’s not James Dean. He’s a guy who’s creepy.
""I was old enough to know that something was wrong. I just remember being very, very aware of this man watching us in the bathtub, and, you know, laying on top of me while I was watching television.""
Wynonna said their mother often wasn’t home, and she became ""incredibly, incredibly protective of Ashley.""
Ashley said one time the live-in boyfriend discovered the girls had written on the walls, ""and he hung me out the bedroom window by my ankles.""

Naomi wrote in her memoir about how he moved to an apartment across the street from them after she broke up with him so he could stalk her.
One night, she said, she discovered someone was inside her house. When she went inside, her ex grabbed her in a jealous rage, demanding to know if she'd been with another man.
""As he was raping me, I prayed he wouldn’t kill me because my kids needed me,"" she wrote.
Ashley said she felt ""abandoned"" by her parents as a child, adding that everyone thought she was a ""very capable child"" and so ""nobody needed to take care of me.""
Naomi’s widower, Larry Strickland said that while he was on the road touring with Naomi and Wynonna, Ashley was left alone.
""Ashley, I’m sure, felt left behind. You know, she suffered, she suffered because of that. It changed her,"" Strickland said in the docuseries.
She moved in with her father in her junior year of high school, but she said he wasn’t home much and was using drugs as well.
Wynonna called the closeness with her mother a ""blessing and a burden"" because she felt ""responsible for making her feel better.""  (A&E)
""My hunch is the justification for abandoning me came from this belief that I was this very capable child … so nobody needed to take care of me. And both of my parents had those beliefs,"" Ashley said.
She also remembered dealing with chickenpox by herself in a motel room when she was a young girl.
""Mom was working and then going out at night, so I was in this strange place with the chickenpox. I just slept all the time,"" Ashley said.
Naomi had moved with the girls back to Kentucky at that time, but she was still struggling with nine-to-five jobs, before she and Wynonna found musical success.
""That was a bout of childhood depression,"" Ashley said, referring to a disease she would continue to battle, much of the time unnoticed.
""I would just watch the commercials and get out the cleaning products that were advertised and just copy what I saw on television,"" Ashley remembered of taking care of herself at the motel.
Ashley Judd said her mother's love of an audience wasn't about ego but rather ""basic self-worth.""  (A&E)
When she was 14 years old, Ashley was sent to model in Japan, where she said she was raped twice.
She said that when her mom later found out from Ashley’s diary about the assault, Naomi ""sneered"" at the idea, referring to the man who raped her as her ""boyfriend.""
""But I was a little girl. I was not a participant. I was a victim. There’s no such thing as consent, and Mom and I had a lot of these conversations later in life,"" Ashley said. ""And her understanding of sexual assault and rape was not the perspective into which she grew and evolved. She just didn’t have that information and perspective.
""So, her reaction was to sneer at me. I was shut down. My own experience and reality invalidated and denied, which in her heart today would be a very painful lament.""
""One of the reasons I have decided that mom left this world is because of trauma, generational trauma, family stuff that never got healed or fixed.""
But she added that her experience of her mother is a ""description not an indictment. Everyone was doing the best they could.""
Dan Potter, musical director for the Judds, said he understood why Wynonna struggled with her weight in her singing career.
""She was wanting to not be attractive,"" he told the producers of the documentary. ""Things happened to her that caused her to not want to be attractive.""
""I was molested at 12, so my whole sexuality thing was really stamped out because I, just at 12, really shut down,"" Wynonna revealed. ""So, I carried the weight, literally and figuratively.""
Her weight, which she said she put on because food became a ""soother"" to her like drugs or alcohol, became an issue after she and her mom found success as a country duo.

""Mom was very hard on me,"" she said, ""because she was terrified of losing me, of course, but she never would say it that way. It was always, ‘Well, if you lost 20 pounds, you’d be a pop star.’ I remember that conversation very well.""
Wynonna noted it was the same kind of thing her grandmother said to her mom growing up.
""That’s why I would get so angry because I knew it was being passed down,"" she added.
She said her mother’s sexuality on stage when they performed together ""so aggravated"" her.
""She was 36 years old. She was ready to be fire,"" Wynonna laughed. ""As kids would say today, she had drip. She was foxy and ready to rumble. Man, she had the modes down, but then I was so aggravated by her sexuality.""
She added that she wished her bond with her mom could have been harmonious like their music, but ""there was a lot of dysfunction.""

Strickland, who is also a musician, admitted in the docuseries he was ""jealous as crap"" of Naomi’s success early on in her career.
Naomi wrote in her memoir that after she found out that their song ""Mama He’s Crazy"" was No. 1, Strickland stood up and walked out the door.
""I was jealous as crap of her, you know,"" the 76-year-old admitted of his late wife, ""so we just kind of fell apart a little bit.""
Naomi described in a 1987 interview played in the docuseries that Strickland ""left me"" when he found out that ""Mama He’s Crazy"" had gone No. 1. ""But we’re back together now.""
Naomi wrote in her memoir that she met Strickland in 1979 when his gospel group, The Stamps Quartet, walked into the building where she was a secretary in Nashville.
The group had toured with Elvis Presley for the last three years of his life.
""I mean, it was almost a love at first sight kind of thing,"" Strickland said of Naomi in the docuseries.
He said they didn’t have any money at that time, and he’d started his own band, Memphis, which toured around the country playing clubs.
""I was trying to find my way,"" he said. ""Naomi, she was the breadwinner. We were dirt poor. It was trying times, very trying times.""
Strickland said Naomi would work during the night at her new job as a nurse, and she would knock on doors on Nashville’s Music Row during the day.
""So, she was doing it all,"" he said.

""Only a handful of people make it through [into the industry],"" he added.
After years of hard work, Naomi and Wynonna got their big break after meeting Nashville producer Brent Maher at her nursing job and signing with RCA Records in 1983.
""If you can imagine all of those years of Naomi fighting the fight, all of the meetings, all of the ‘no’s, it had to be staggering,"" Maher said of when they signed with RCA.
Naomi wrote in her memoir that, one night, while she and Wynonna were on the road, Strickland called long distance.
""He wanted to change his life,"" she wrote of Strickland. ""‘I’m getting off the road. I love you, so I’m asking you to marry me. What’s your answer?’""
""I was just being funny, but I said, ‘How would you like to be buried with my people?’"" Strickland told the producers of the docuseries. ""That’s an old saying.""

Naomi wrote in her memoir of that time, ""We’d had the greatest year of our entire lives, not only professionally but personally as well.""
Strickland and Naomi wed in 1989 and remained married until her death in 2022.

From action-packed movie roles to high-profile relationships, Ana de Armas is no stranger to the spotlight.
However, the 37-year-old Cuban actress - who has recently been photographed out and about with Tom Cruise - has no interest in living a life in the public eye.
During an interview with Elle in 2022, the ""Blonde"" star, who had a brief relationship with Ben Affleck in 2020, said the constant interest in her love life while dating the ""Gone Girl"" actor was ""horrible.""
""Which is good,"" she added. ""That’s one of the reasons why I left L.A.""

De Armas, who grew up in Cuba before relocating to Spain at 18, moved to Los Angeles when she was 26 years old, in hopes of making a name for herself as an actor and director.
But she got more than she bargained for.
In 2020, De Armas sparked a relationship with her ""Deep Water""co-star, Affleck. The actress broke off their roughly one-year relationship because she didn't want to be Los Angeles-based, reports said at the time of the split. The actress and Affleck split in January 2021, and insiders claimed the breakup was ""amicable.""

""There is deep love and respect there,"" a source told People magazine at the time. ""Ben continues to want to work on himself. He has three jobs lined up, and he’s a solid father at home. They are both happy with where they are in their lives.""
Another insider close to the former couple added that ""she broke it off.""
""Their relationship was complicated,"" the insider added. ""Ana doesn't want to be Los Angeles-based and Ben obviously has to, since his kids live in Los Angeles.""

One year later, de Armas confirmed that building a life in Los Angeles was just not in the cards for her.
""Going through it [myself] confirmed my thoughts about, 'This is not the place for me to be,’"" she told Elle. ""It became a little bit too much. There’s no escape. There’s no way out. It’s always the feeling of something that you don’t have, something missing. It’s a city that keeps you anxious.""
In an effort to escape public scrutiny, the ""No Time to Die"" star said she intentionally stays away from the internet.
ANA DE ARMAS SEEMINGLY ADDRESSES RUMORS THAT SHE'S DATING EX BEN AFFLECK AGAIN: 'I DON'T THINK SO'
""I deleted Twitter years ago,"" she told Elle at the time. ""I have barely been on Instagram for almost a year.""

Most recently, however, de Armas and Cruise, who are reportedly collaborating on a project, have been spotted together in London on several occasions over the past few months, fueling rumors of a potential romance.
Speculation began to swirl when the pair were photographed together for the first time on the night before Valentine's Day.

On Feb. 13, the two were pictured walking through London's Soho neighborhood as de Armas carried what appeared to be takeout bags of food from a restaurant. The two stopped for photos with fans before leaving in a taxi together.
A source later told People magazine that Cruise and the ""Ghosted"" actress had dined out with their agents, saying they were ""discussing potential collaborations down the line."" The insider claimed that Cruise and de Armas ""appeared to have no romantic connection"" and were ""just friends.""
However, the duo further fueled dating speculation when they were again photographed together on March 14 as they arrived at the London Heliport by helicopter at night.

While speaking with People, a source said that Cruise and de Armas echoed the statements made about them, and insisted they are collaborating on an upcoming project, but are not romantically involved.
According to the insider, director Liman also accompanied the two on the trip, but further details about the project were not disclosed.
The 62-year-old actor and de Armas were most recently seen chatting as they walked down a path in a London park on the ""Knives Out"" star's 37th birthday last week.
In a photo and video captured by a bystander and shared on X, Cruise was seen wearing a white polo t-shirt with dark blue jeans while de Armas sported a light-colored t-shirt with jeans, white sneakers and a brown crossbody bag.

Cruise walked next to de Armas with his hands behind his back and was holding what appeared to be an olive green dog leash with a pouch. The pair were accompanied by another woman as well as security guards during their outing.
Celebrity matchmaker Alessandra Conti previously told Fox News Digital that she doubts the relationship between Cruise and de Armas is actually platonic, noting the two are both guarded about their private lives.
""Since his devastating and public split with Katie [Holmes], he has kept a low profile when it comes to his personal life. However, his new relationship with Ana de Armas could be his big comeback into being in a celebrity power couple,"" Conti said.
""As a matchmaker in Beverly Hills for nearly 13 years, it is clear that Tom was gravely affected by the public nature of his relationship with Katie and was gun-shy and incredibly private with any other potential romances since the split back in 2012.""

""The fact that he was seen publicly with Ana is a huge deal,"" Conti added. ""My celebrity clients know exactly how to keep their love lives under wraps if that is their desire. So, this is a clear indicator that he is feeling secure about the potential of this romance, though sources are saying that it is merely because they are in a film together.
""Even if they are simply working together, as a celebrity matchmaker, I believe this couple is incredibly compatible for a number of reasons and do think that this could be a lasting Hollywood match if they give it a chance to blossom.""

""Pioneer Woman"" star Ree Drummond recently opened up about restarting her health journey.
In an April 30 post on her Pioneer Woman blog, Drummond, 56, contemplated the four years that had passed since she penned a 2021 blog post in which she shared the tips that helped her shed over 50 pounds.
The Food Network star revealed that she had gained weight after taking a year-long break from her regimen, but she has now recommitted to the plan that previously brought her success.
""Boy has it been an adventure since then! I am, after all, a woman and a human person, and as such, I've had natural fluctuations since this original post was written — but much more so in the past year-plus,"" Drummond wrote. ""Bottom line, starting at the end of 2023 I stopped exercising and kinda stopped paying attention to what I was eating.""

She continued, ""Well, around February of this year, I decided to jump back the plan I'd found success with in 2021, just not quite as high a gear as the first time. Long story short, I have found that it all still holds true, and FOR ME, it is working again like clockwork or science or whatever the word is.""

""The very hardest part was the first week to ten days,"" Drummond added. ""Today it's not that hard at all, and in fact, it's actually rewarding as I'm feeling better and better all the time.""
The new grandmother shared a couple of changes that she had made to her 2021 plan though she noted the ""the gist of it is the same.""

""The game changer for me is two-fold: First, I'm building muscle again, which is crucial. I do lunges, squats, deadlifts, and floor exercises with ankle weights. Second, I'm eating more protein and keeping it a higher percentage of my calories,"" she wrote.

In addition, Drummond explained that she was no longer weighing her food or counting calories.
""I feel that after doing that for four or five months back in 2021, it really gave me more of an awareness of portion sizes and general calories,"" she wrote.

While Drummond gave up drinking alcohol completely for four months at the beginning of her weight loss journey in 2021, the celebrity chef wrote that she is not completely abstaining this time around. She explained that she enjoys having a little white wine topped with Topo Chico sparkling water ""so it's kind of a wine spritzer type of thing.""

""I still LOVE the Happy Scale app,"" she wrote. ""During the year I was gaining weight, I didn't use it very often. I'm using it again and forget how helpful it is!
""I can't emphasize enough (just to repeat) how important it is to build muscle,"" Drummond added. ""And how important protein is as a part of that goal. In February, the scale was pretty stubborn until I bit the bullet and started doing all the leg/butt exercises. Within a week, it kicked in.""

Meghan Markle packed on the PDA with Prince Harry on Friday at a Beyoncé concert in Los Angeles.
""About last night…. Thank you @beyonce and team for an amazing concert (and a very fun date night)! All love,"" the Duchess of Sussex wrote on her Instagram on Saturday, while sharing several photos and photos showing the royal couple dancing, embracing and kissing.
The Saturday post comes less than two weeks after Markle said that she and Harry are in the ""honeymoon"" phase of their marriage.
The 43-year-old likened their relationship to the final round of a video game where you ""slay the dragon, save the princess,"" and dispelled any notion of divorce on friend Jamie Kern Lima's podcast late last month following months of speculation.

She continued, ""I always think about it like the end of Super Mario Brothers and you get to the final final level, and what’s the goal in Super Mario Brothers? Slay the dragon, save the princess.""

Markle said, ""You have to imagine, at the beginning, everyone has butterflies, and then we immediately went into the trenches together right out of the gate, six months into dating. So now, seven years later when you have a little bit of breathing space, you can just enjoy each other in a new way, and that's why I feel like it's more of a honeymoon period for us now.""

The PDA post also comes a week after Markle talked on her new podcast, ""Confessions of a Female Founder,"" about the stresses of being under the ""microscope"" of the media while discussing launching her lifestyle brand.

""Whatever I put out in the world will have so much attention,"" she said on the podcast on Tuesday. ""I go, ‘yeah.’ And there's a flip side to that coin, which we know. It's a microscope that a lot of people don't have to experience.""
Markle rarely shares PDA photos with her husband, but after she started a new Instagram at the beginning of the year when she launched her lifestyle brand, the duchess began to post pictures of her family, including her children, (although mainly the backs of their heads).

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/miley-cyrus-reunites-dad-billy-ray-cyrus-she-breaks-silence-rumored-family-feud","Miley Cyrus reunites with dad Billy Ray Cyrus, breaks silence on rumored feud with parents","Miley Cyrus wore a sheer gold outfit when she walked the red carpet at the 2024 Grammy Awards.
Miley Cyrus broke her silence about rumors of a feud with her parents after she reunited with her father, Billy Ray Cyrus.
On Friday, Billy Ray took to Instagram to post a selfie of him, daughter Miley and son Braison Cyrus. The family members were joined by the 32-year-old ""Wrecking Ball"" singer's boyfriend, Maxx Morando, as they posed outside while wearing sunglasses in the photo Billy Ray posted to mark Braison's 31st birthday.
""Happy Birthday Braison!!!!!"" Billy Ray, 63, wrote in the caption, tagging Miley, Braison and Morando.
A day later, Miley posted an Instagram story after social media users had pointed out her mother, Tish Cyrus, unfollowed her earlier in the week.

""I rarely comment on rumors but my mama and I are too tight for anything to ever come between us,"" Miley wrote in the post she uploaded Saturday.

""She’s my best friend,"" the Grammy winner added. ""Like a lot of moms, she doesn’t know how to work her phone and somehow unfollowed me — simple, coincidental and uninteresting.
""My dad and I have had our challenges over the years. Now, in my thirties, family is my priority above all else.
""I’m at peace knowing bridges have been built and time has done a lot of healing. Grateful for the good health and love that flows through my family.""

On Wednesday, Billy Ray indicated he was planning to meet with Miley. The ""Achy Breaky Heart"" singer shared a throwback video of Miley playing the piano, which he captioned, ""Can’t wait to see this young lady. Crazy how time flies.""
Later that day, fans flocked to the comments section of a post on Tish's Instagram page, questioning her about appearing to unfollow her daughter on the platform after her ex-husband's post.
Tish clarified the situation in a reply to one Instagram user, writing, ""have no idea how that happened, but it’s fixed now!""
On Thursday, Tish doubled down in a post on her X page.
""I would never unfollow Miley, her and I are as close as we’ve always been. Period. Love you Little @mileycyrus,"" the podcast host wrote.

Rumors of a family rift began to swirl after Tish and Billy Ray's divorce in 2022. The former couple tied the knot in 1992, and Billy Ray adopted Tish's daughter Brandi, 37, and son Trace, 36, from a previous marriage.
The two later welcomed Miley, Braison and daughter Noah Cyrus, 25. Billy Ray is also father to Christopher Cyrus with ex-wife Kristin Luckey.

Speculation of a Cyrus family feud began after Noah and Braison were noticeably absent from Tish's wedding when she married Dominic Purcell in August 2023.
Miley served as her mother's maid of honor and walked Tish down the aisle during the Malibu nuptials. Tish's wedding was also attended by Brandi and Trace.
Months later, Miley was absent when Billy Ray married Australian singer Firerose, 36. Billy Ray and Firerose announced their engagement in November 2022. A month later, Miley and Billy Ray unfollowed each other on Instagram.
The ""Party in the U.S.A"" hitmaker further fueled rumors of a feud with Billy Ray after she snubbed him when she won her first-ever Grammy Award in February 2024.
Billy Ray filed for divorce from Firerose in July 2024, and their split was finalized that August.

In January, Billy Ray stumbled onstage during a performance at President Donald Trump's inauguration celebration. Afterward, fans and family members voiced concerns about the singer, questioning his health and stability.
On Jan. 23, Trace penned an open letter to Billy Ray on Instagram, expressing his family's worry and asking his father to seek help.
Trace posted a follow-up message after his first letter, claiming his adoptive father was threatening him with legal action over the initial letter.
A few days later, Billy Ray seemingly responded to Trace's public plea, saying he continues to pray for his children and their mother.

At the time, People reported that Miley planned to stay out of the conflict.
""Miley used to feel overwhelmed by the family drama. She worked hard to remove herself. She's not about to get involved again,"" a source told the outlet. ""She's in a great place now. She's thriving and looking out for herself.""
In a comment to People magazine, Braison, who worked with Billy Ray on his new album, weighed in on the strained relations between his dad and brother.

""Holy s---. I seldom ever swear in my post but this deserves one! You are witnessing in real time what it feels like for a Dad who with in less than one weeks time has had his a-- kicked and his mind blown by not one …but two of his own daughters,"" he wrote, tagging his daughters.
""Flesh and blood … completely taking their art to a whole new level,"" he added. ""Congratulations girls ! Well done.  I’m so damn proud of both of you. I’m actually crying as I write this. Thank God you can’t see me.
""Have fun now and be happy! Love Dad.""

""It was a great experience,"" he told the outlet of making the movie, according to Deadline. ""I was very excited to do it. I knew Stanley’s movies very well, and I was introduced to him through [""The Firm"" director] Sydney Pollack. So, Stanley called Sydney ’cause he wanted me to make a movie. He sent me a fax.

""I flew out to his house, and I landed in his backyard. I read the script the day before, and we spent the day talking about it. I knew all of his films. I spoke to Scorsese about him and Sydney Pollack … so I knew what he did and how he worked. Then it was basically he and I getting to know each other. And when we were doing that, I suggested Nicole play the role [of Alice]. Because obviously she’s a great actress.""
He called making the movie ""a very unique experience"" and recalled that when they arrived to film, ""the script was just an idea. We [were] constantly rewriting the scenes and shooting the scenes and then reshooting the scenes to really find the tone of the film.""

Zach Bryan is taking a stand against a critic.
The ""Something in the Orange"" singer took to Instagram Friday to call out another singer-songwriter, John Moreland, for a subtle dig he seemingly made about him on his own account.
""$350 M is a lot to pay for the f---in off-brand version of me,"" Moreland wrote to his Instagram story. ""Y'all have a great day.""

Variety reported earlier this week that Bryan had made a new deal with his label, Warner Records, to extend his contract to include at least two more albums. The outlet claimed that he has also either sold or is currently in the process of selling his publishing catalog, and that together, the two deals total $350 million.
Bryan, who wrote and recorded a duet with Moreland called ""Memphis; The Blues"" on his 2024 album ""The Great American Bar Scene,"" shared a screenshot of Moreland's comment and added a response of his own.
""Yooo just saw this from an artist I've always respected and supported,"" he wrote. ""Not trying to be dramatic but refuse to have anyone with a problem with me on my records. Replacing Memphis the Blues. If it goes down for a bit just know this is the reason!""
He added, ""No hard feelings! Confused as s---, Tulsans look out for Tulsans!""

""Memphis; The Blues"" is currently unavailable on streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, though Bryan has assured his fans that this is only temporary.

Justin Bieber is admitting to being ""flawed"" in a series of posts made to social media Friday.
The pop star, who has been in the spotlight lately for his concerning behavior on social media, started off his latest Instagram confessionals by writing, ""I'm just an average flawed guy. I've done things that have hurt others. I continue to do and say things that hurt others unintentionally.""
""Yet I woke up this morning with another opportunity to grow and not be so selfish today.""

Bieber made another post shortly after that, telling his followers that ""Sometimes I think I'm gonna get exposed if I tell people how selfish I am. Like if I admitted that, maybe people wouldn't like me or trust me.""
The ""Baby"" singer explained that he felt that if he was honest about feeling selfish, then he would be ""disqualified from the dreams I had of being included,"" but said that the more honest he is about things, the more freedom he has.
In another post, Bieber wrote that he ""can't control"" how he feels when he wakes up each morning, and that in the past ""I would find myself even subconsciously blaming god for the bad feeling I woke up with rather than communicate with him and ask him to help me have a change of perspective.""

Now, he's ""been really asking god to help me see the best in people. Even after being used in the way I have.""
He said that it's ""easier"" to call others greedy than it is for one to admit to being greedy themselves, and that ""Only god can remove the greed and selfishness from our hearts.""He added, ""Trying harder won’t work. Cuz I tried lol.""

Taylor Swift has been subpoenaed as a witness in Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's heated legal battle stemming from the production of their film ""It Ends With Us.""

""Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see ‘It Ends With Us’ until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history,"" Swift's representative told Fox News Digital.

Lively and Baldoni starred together in the romance drama ""It Ends with Us,"" which was based on Colleen Hoover's 2016 book and premiered in August 2024. After a press tour rife with rumors of behind-the-scenes issues between the two, Baldoni and Lively filed lawsuits against each other.

In January, Baldoni accused Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, of civil extortion, defamation and more in a $400 million lawsuit — which happened to mention Swift.

The ""Jane the Virgin"" star's lawsuit followed Lively's own December lawsuit, in which she accused the actor of sexual harassment while filming ""It Ends With Us."" However, Baldoni insisted that Lively had ""falsely"" accused him in an attempt to repair her reputation following the fallout around the movie's press tour after she allegedly took control of the film.
In an attempt to prove his claims that Lively had taken control of the movie's production, Baldoni's legal team suggested that the actress had used her friendship with the globally famous Swift to threaten him. While working on the film, Lively insisted on rewriting the infamous rooftop scene. Baldoni had been hesitant about the idea, but he told the actress he would ""take a look at what she put together,"" according to the complaint.
Swift's representative said she was not involved with the movie aside from licensing one song.  (Getty Images)
Afterward, Lively invited Baldoni over to her New York City home, where the actor said he had felt that Swift and Reynolds had pressured him into using the rewritten scene. ""Later, Baldoni felt obliged to text Lively to say that he had liked her pages and hadn’t needed Reynolds and her megacelebrity friend to pressure him,"" the complaint said.

""… I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor [emoji] You really are a talent across the board. Really excited nd [sic] grateful to do this together,"" Baldoni's text read, according to the complaint.
Lively shared a lengthy response, in which she referred to Swift and Reynolds as ""dragons"" who protect her.

""Both Ryan and [redacted] have established themselves as absolute titans as writers and storytellers outside of their primary gig – just singing or just acting or [redacted] just directing. I'm so lucky to have them as creative barometers,"" Lively's text, included in the complaint, read. ""But also to have them as people who prop me up and make sure I'm seen for all I can, and do offer. Because they know firsthand all I contribute. They also know I'm not always as good at making sure I'm seen and utilized for fear of threatening egos, or fear of affecting the ease of the process. They don't give a s--- about that. And because of that, everyone listens to them with immense respect and enthusiasm. So I guess I have to stop worrying about people liking me.""
Baldoni believed that ""the message could not have been clearer,"" according to the lawsuit. ""Baldoni was not just dealing with Lively. He was also facing Lively’s ‘dragons,’ two of the most influential and wealthy celebrities in the world, who were not afraid to make things very difficult for him.""

Both sides have given no indication that they intend to settle out of court. The legal conflict is currently set to head to trial before a New York court in March 2026.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/billy-joels-wife-says-singer-trying-get-better-after-postponing-concerts-due-medical-condition","Billy Joel's wife says singer's ‘health has to take priority’ after he postponed tour due to medical condition","Billy Joel's wife, Alexis Joel, shared an update on the singer's health after he postponed his tour for four months to recover from a medical condition that required surgery and rehabilitation.
Billy Joel's wife, Alexis Roderick Joel, is speaking out about her journey with endometriosis.
Alexis, who has been married to the 75-year-old rock legend since 2015, struggled with debilitating symptoms, misdiagnoses and failed surgeries for years before later discovering that she was suffering from the frequently misunderstood condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus.
During the time in which Alexis was battling her then-unknown disease and experiencing chronic pain, she was also raising her two young children and accompanying Billy while he performed at concerts around the world.
While speaking with Fox News Digital, Alexis admitted that being on tour with Billy and her children while dealing with the symptoms of endometriosis had been ""really rough.""

Alexis continued, ""So, especially with kids, if you've ever traveled with children and done a time zone change, that alone is an insane situation. So, if you add in also having a husband, that requires time and attention — you know, he's working, we're not vacationing. And me going through what I'm going through, it was really rough.
""Luckily, when he's touring, we have a lot of support, which was really helpful,"" And it was huge. So I'm lucky in that I do have people to help me. And you have to, because you reach your limit. I mean, there's nothing you can do.""
Alexis and the ""Piano Man' singer share daughters Della, 9, and Remy, 7. Billy is also father to daughter Alexa Ray Joel, 39, whom he shares with his ex-wife Christie Brinkley, 71.

Alexis explained that it was an especially challenging time because neither she nor Billy knew what was causing her symptoms.
""We all entered this not knowing anything about it, I think as most of us do,"" she explained. ""And it's difficult because I know that I didn't feel well.""
""And I also know I didn't want him to tell me that I didn't feel well,"" Alexis continued with a laugh. ""Your fuse is very short at that point when you're dealing with two little kids traveling the world and you're in excruciating pain. And every day, you don't know what your day is going to be like, so it's difficult to plan.""

""But as time has gone on, he's extremely supportive,"" she added. ""So picking up where I leave off and covering my deficits during that time was huge. We're just always researching — he'll email me articles like ‘Did you know that this happens with endometriosis?'""
""Never in a million years would I think that he would be sending me that kind of stuff, but when you're watching someone suffer, you pick up. You have to. It's what we do, we're a family.""

Over the past few months, Billy has been struggling with health challenges of his own.
In March, the five-time Grammy Award winner shared a statement on social media in which it was announced that he was postponing eight tour dates due to a ""medical condition.""

""Joel is expected to make a full recovery. The tour will resume at Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh on July 5, 2025.""
Billy shared a personal comment as well, writing, ""While I regret postponing any shows, my health must come first. I look forward to getting back on stage and sharing the joy of live music with our amazing fans. Thank you for your understanding.""

""He's doing well,"" she said. ""It's funny, I was just having this conversation the other day. He's going to be 76. And I don't think of him that way. People don't think of him in that way, but he is. And he's been doing this job nonstop for 15 years — just this recent run.""
""With the exception of COVID, he's been working every two weeks for 15-plus years,"" Alexis continued. ""And it's a lot. At 75, 76, there comes a time where you can't always plan out everything you need to do a year and a half in advance, you know? And that's how long these schedules are. That's when you're booking things. You're booking it that long prior.""
""So, sometimes your health has to take priority, and things have to get postponed,"" she noted. ""But really, in the grand scheme of things, he's a healthy person, and he's well and working on himself, trying to get better and do what he has to do medically. So it's important, you know, we need him around so he has to do what he has to do. I had to do what I had to do. Now he has to do what he has to do.""
""But at least I'm able to pick up his deficits now, so it's OK.""
Alexis said Billy is ""doing well"" and ""trying to get better."" ( Mireya Acierto/Getty Images for The Everglades Foundation)
Alexis, who usually stays out of the spotlight, first went public with her health battle in a post shared on Billy's Instagram page during Endometriosis Awareness Month in March.
She posted a photo of herself posing with Dr. Tamer Seckin, who she described in the caption as her ""earth angel."" Seckin is a New York-based gynecologist, laparoscopic surgeon and endometriosis specialist who co-founded the Endometriosis Foundation of America (EndoFound) with celebrity chef Padma Lakshmi in 2009. In her post, Alexis recalled how she had found Seckin and how he had been able to treat her condition.
""We all have war stories, and I am no different: years of pain, misdiagnosis, failed surgeries, followed by internal bleeding, and most importantly, Doctor after Doctor telling me I was fine,"" Alexis wrote. ""I ran the gamut from ‘It’s all in your head’ to ‘Just get a hysterectomy.'""

""One surgery later, 27 lesions removed, one less appendix and my entire abdominal cavity rid of this horrible disease. I am forever grateful,"" Alexis added. ""The work he does with The Endometriosis Foundation of America is so important to this battle.  They work to raise awareness, implement teaching in schools, and continue his research for the next generation.  Our family has privately supported this work, but in honor of March being Endometriosis Awareness Month, I wanted to do my part to help others who are unheard.  It is a tough road, but believe in yourself and find your earth angel - they are out there!""
On May 1, Billy joined Alexis as she spoke at a press conference to announce the grand opening of the Seckin Endometriosis Center for Women's Health at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). EndoFound and CSHL partnered to establish the center, which was named after Seckin. According to a press release, it is the first dedicated endometriosis research center within a leading U.S. basic science institution.

Billy later posted photos from the event on his Instagram page, noting in the caption that the Joel Foundation, which he co-founded with Alexis, supports the work of EndoFound.
Endometriosis is estimated to affect more than one in 10 women of reproductive age — over 200 million worldwide. Though surgery can help alleviate pain from endometriosis, symptoms may eventually return. There is currently no cure for endometriosis.

During an interview with Fox News Digital, Clarkson, 65, talked about her own real-life experiences that her latest movie ""Lilly"" brought to the surface for her.

""For me, Lilly's journey was a deeply emotional journey, a journey filled with strife and struggle and ultimately triumph, but how I've toiled, how I have labored to have a career and still have a career at 65, is a loss of love. Loss of leaving my family behind in New Orleans.""
""I'm not a 25-year-old woman. I've lived through a lot in my life. I've survived Hollywood, okay.""
The movie sparked memories of Clarkson's ""struggles"" in her life, but she's proud to still ""be here"" and making a mark in the entertainment industry.

Of course, she raised five daughters. My mother raised five daughters, and we're all working women and my sisters are very accomplished people.

""The industry, it's grown by leaps and bounds and women finally really now, we don't have a full seat at the table, but we're very, very, close.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/vince-vaughn-joins-rocky-sopranos-legends-spotlight-food-family-tradition","Vince Vaughn joins 'Rocky' and 'Sopranos' legends to spotlight food, family and tradition","‘FOX & Friends Weekend’ hosts give their take on actor Vince Vaughn’s visit to the White House.
Vince Vaughn teamed up with a quartet of iconic veteran actresses for a new comedy that celebrates Italian-American heritage through the lens of food, family and tradition.
The 55-year-old actor is starring alongside Lorraine Bracco, 70; Talia Shire, 79; Susan Sarandon, 78; and Brenda Vaccaro, 85, in the Netflix movie ""Nonnas,"" titled after the Italian word for ""grandmothers."" Based on a real-life story, the film follows MTA worker Jody ""Joe"" Scaravella (Vaughn), who decides to change his life after the death of his beloved mother Maria and open an Italian restaurant, Enoteca Maria, to honor her and his late grandmother.
Rather than hiring professional chefs, Joe enlists four Italian grandmothers, including Roberta (Bracco), Teresa (Shire), Gia (Sarandon) and Antonella (Vaccaro), to be the restaurant's cooks using their own traditional methods and recipes. During the movie, Joe begins to heal from the grief of losing his mother after forming close bonds with the nonnas and finding a new sense of purpose.
""I really enjoyed the connection of food and family [and] the idea that love and culture was passed down through food and get-togethers, and that those gifts stay with us always,"" Vaughn told Entertainment Weekly in April.

While speaking with Screen Rant, Vaughn explained how he resonated with the movie's themes and his character's journey throughout the film.

""I like movies that are exploring things in life, moments, experiences,"" the ""Wedding Crashers"" star said. ""I think one of the powerful things about the movie is you have the perspective of being a kid for all of us, and what that is in those family events. And then it kind of flashes forward, and you realize the impact of being in a very different stage of life.""
""I was raised with my granny in the house with me, and so I really loved that this was a real place and a true story,"" Vaughn continued. ""I'd never heard of the restaurant, but Joe created a place where he brought Italian grandmothers to be the cooks to make the recipes that were their family, recipes that they used to feed their family and to celebrate life. I thought that was such an interesting idea and such a great send-up to these ladies and this culture.""
Vaughn plays real-life restaurateur Joe Scaravella in ""Nonnas."" (Netflix )
""Then you're dealing with the loss of a parent, but recognizing where they're alive — in spirit and food — and what they taught you, and searching for that bond, that connection,"" he added.  ""And what does that next chapter look like for someone? What do you do with these feelings? And how do you create community and family?
""I think what a lot of people want is love and connection and good experiences and relationships and bonds that are meaningful. That's what we all cherish and strive to have in our lives.""

Chbosky, who previously directed ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" said that casting Bracco, Shire, Sarandon and Vaccaro as the nonnas ""was a process of saying, ‘Please, God?’ and then they said yes.""

""I'm a massive fan and just been moved by all of them and so many incredible performances,"" he said. ""I certainly took advantage of the time to ask a lot of questions about a lot of their work that I love.""
Vaughn continued, ""It was fun to get just to sit back and watch them, like the character in the movie, where you create the space for these women to cook and to prepare their craft, which is food. In the same way for me, it was fun to sit back and get to watch these dynamics when they were having scenes to exchange and just watch them interact with each other. It was incredible.""

""I mean, my parents were both born in the Great Depression,"" Vaughn continued. ""So I was never that removed from that kind of struggle. So some of the stuff that's talked about today, I just can't relate to it because I had so much family that were just, for generations, just living, but happy. Lots of struggle, but always happy. I never heard them complain.""
""No one would sit around and complain,"" he added. ""So you really did appreciate and have fun and enjoy moments when you got to be with the family and have some laughs. That was so much of a part of it. So I think it's a send-up, it's an honoring of these women that have fed and loved and nurtured and supported families.""

As opening statements in Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' sex-trafficking trial are set to kick off Monday, the defense and prosecution have seemingly run into a few roadblocks.
The prosecution has lost communication with Victim 3 and cannot locate her, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey.
""The disappearance of a key victim at trial is crippling for the prosecution,"" attorney John J. Perlstein told Fox News Digital. ""I doubt it impacts other counts; however, it will severely impact the one relating to the AWOL victim. A lot of times, people reconsider wanting to be involved in such a high-profile matter. Good prosecutors will adapt and, hopefully, their case is not dependent on the cooperation of one person.""

No-shows ""add stress"" to any trial and witnesses can become non-responsive for many reasons, according to Judie Saunders, partner of NYC-based ASK LLP.
""If this witness doesn’t show, that’s a problem,"" entertainment lawyer Tre Lovell explained to Fox News Digital. ""One of the biggest questions in this prosecution is the small number of victim-witnesses in light of all the civil lawsuits and ‘victims’ out there.
""To have only three to four actual victims testifying against allegations of two decades-long criminality is telling. Although the government will have other witnesses to testify (i.e. staff workers, Diddy associates, people that were part of his entourage), the victims will be the most compelling and important people on the stand.""

Diddy has been charged with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution in a federal indictment unsealed Sept. 17. He has maintained his innocence. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Authorities allege Diddy ran a criminal enterprise through his businesses, including Bad Boy Entertainment, Combs Enterprises and Combs Global, among others. He used ""firearms, threats of violence, coercion and verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse"" to fulfill his sexual desires, according to prosecutors.

While opening statements will begin Monday, the jury panel has yet to be finalized, according to Friday's status conference in the case. Diddy's legal team was concerned about jurors getting cold feet over the weekend, and Judge Arun Subramanian agreed.
""This doesn’t necessarily signal a struggle to seat the jury; it’s more about being cautious and setting the trial up for a smooth start with minimal disruptions,"" criminal defense lawyer Jo-Anna Nieves told Fox News Digital. ""It’s a thoughtful and fairly common precaution.""
Criminal defense attorney Eric Faddis added, ""It’s normal for different phases of the trial to take longer than expected, but apparently at least one of the 45 potential jurors remaining has recently asked to be removed from this controversial, high-profile case.""

Diddy's lawyer has also revealed the defense plans to introduce the idea that there was mutual violence in the rapper's relationships. Legal experts explained this tactic is ""risky and complicated.""
""The defense is essentially arguing that the relationship with Victim 1 was volatile on both sides, so it shouldn’t be seen as one-sided abuse or coercion,"" Nieves explained. ""That might sound plausible at first, but in court, mutual violence doesn’t automatically cancel out claims of coercion. The focus will be on who held the power in the relationship. If Diddy controlled the situation through money, status, threats or manipulation, then any violence from the other party won’t excuse or equalize that dynamic.""
""Jurors also tend to be turned off by strategies that seem like victim-blaming,"" she continued. ""Trying to make the victim look just as responsible can backfire, especially if there’s evidence that Diddy was the primary aggressor. This approach might raise some questions in the jury’s mind, but it’s a strategy that depends heavily on context and credibility.""
A ""mutual combat"" defense ""doesn’t transform an allegedly non-consensual sexual encounter into a consensual one,"" Faddis added. ""Though, if accepted as true, it may mitigate Diddy’s alleged actions in the eyes of the jurors.""

Diddy's mutual violence position is likely going to be used to undercut the video of the rapper engaging in a physical altercation with ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura.
""Diddy’s legal team needs to distance the Cassie Ventura hotel video from the allegations in this case and ‘box it,'"" Lovell explained.
""This means describe it as a mutually violent altercation, a fight between two people in a romantic, decade-long relationship that has everything to do with private issues (i.e. infidelity) between a couple as opposed to racketeering or sex trafficking.""

Diddy also faces testimony from Ventura. The musician, who is pregnant, is set to testify using her real name in the trial, People magazine reported. Other alleged victims have been allowed to testify using pseudonyms.
""Cassie will gain sympathy from the jury as being an assault victim and the fact she is a soon-to-be mother,"" Lovell noted. ""Nevertheless, Diddy’s team can remind the jury of how long ago this was, and that she was very different back then. Appearance before a jury is always very important, for both the defendant and credibility of witnesses, but the attorneys can diffuse this through evidence and reminding the jury that everyone in court will be on their best behavior and, by design, not exhibit the conduct for which they are either the subject of the prosecution or a testifying witness.""
While the ""Me & U"" singer's current pregnancy doesn't ""erase proof"" of an allegedly violent past, Perlstein — a top Los Angeles litigator — told Fox News Digital, it could help her seem sympathetic on the stand.
Ventura's pregnancy ""only increases the likelihood"" that jurors will view her as a ""sympathetic witness,"" Faddis told Fox News Digital. ""It also undercuts the defense’s argument that Cassie, a woman modest in stature, is somehow equally involved in and responsible for the alleged physical altercations between the two.""
Diddy has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and denied all the allegations.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/shia-labeouf-once-lived-nyc-park-took-steroids-during-dark-period","Shia LaBeouf once lived in NYC park, took steroids during dark period","Fox News chief religion correspondent Lauren Green reports on Padre Pio’s gifts, including conversion and ‘reading souls,’ as the movie star converts to Catholicism.
Shia LaBeouf is speaking candidly about a troubling time in his career.
The controversial actor, who's been working in Hollywood since he was a child, spoke to The Hollywood Reporter to promote his new film, ""Henry Johnson."" During their conversation, LaBeouf discussed his former feud with fellow actor Alec Baldwin, whom he briefly worked with for a Broadway show called ""Orphans"" in 2013.
LaBeouf was originally supposed to star opposite Al Pacino, but when Pacino left the production, Baldwin replaced him – something that LeBeouf struggled with. As he explained to THR, he was solely to blame for their issues, because he was ""not a nice guy"" at the time.

""By the time Baldwin got there, it was almost unfair,"" he said. ""So he’s dealing with both my fractured little weak ego, right? All this hard prep that I’d done for two years, and my desperate need to show him all my prep, or that he would accept me somehow. I was so insecure. Well, that got contentious in the room. Then he got competitive. That’s just what our relationship turned into.""
He continued, ""I’d be off book, he’d be on book, and he didn’t want me to look at him be off book. That makes it hard to play these scenes out or block this thing even. And no fault against him, he had two weeks to come in because Pacino [dropped out]. I had built the whole thing based on my relationship with Pacino. And that’s gone. So I was kind of heartbroken. When he came in, I’m living in the park, and I’m on steroids, and I’m not in a good way.""
""Fear will make you move different. I found it came from having absolutely no spiritual life … It made me a piece of s--t. Not a nice guy.""
When asked to elaborate, LaBeouf said, ""I was sleeping in Central Park. They keep horses there at this little fire basin. And there’s a whole lot of room around there where you can just chill. You got to move every three or four hours, and the guy comes around, but you can spend most of your time there.""

He confessed that his issues with Baldwin ""got insane,"" but said that the two are ""good"" now.
""Me and him are good because he’s gone through a lot,"" he shared. ""I’ve gone through a lot. We’ve both been able to send each other love and make it right before all the madness happened on both sides. We made it right. He’s a good guy. He’s just like me. Fear will make you move different. I found it came from having absolutely no spiritual life. . . . It made me a piece of s--t. Not a nice guy.""
""I was sleeping in Central Park. They keep horses there at this little fire basin. And there’s a whole lot of room around there where you can just chill.""
LaBeouf has since found his faith. Last year, he received the sacrament of confirmation after converting to Catholicism. He even expressed interest in becoming a deacon.
""Me and Alec would never have these problems now,"" he acknowledged. ""But I was in an island.""

Alec Baldwin said he struggled to get along with Shia LaBeouf when they rehearsed for ""Orphans"" together in 2013. (Jim Spellman)
Baldwin did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
In a 2014 piece he wrote for Vulture, Baldwin spoke about his experience with LaBeouf, admitting that ""there was friction between us from the beginning.""
""LaBeouf seems to carry with him, to put it mildly, a jailhouse mentality wherever he goes. When he came to rehearsal, he was told it was important to memorize his lines. . . . I, however, do not learn my lines in advance. So he began to sulk because he felt we were slowing him down. You could tell right away he loves to argue. And one day he attacked me in front of everyone. He said, ‘You’re slowing me down, and you don’t know your lines. And if you don’t say your lines, I’m just going to keep saying my lines.’""
He ""snorted"" at LaBeouf, and the two had a terse exchange in front of the rest of the cast. Afterward, Baldwin asked for a break, then took the director and stage manager aside and told them, ""One of us is going to go.""

He wrote, ""I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, I’ll go.’ I said don’t fire the kid, I’ll quit. They said no, no, no, no, and they fired him. And I think he was shocked. He had that card, that card you get when you make films that make a lot of money that gives you a certain kind of entitlement. I think he was surprised that it didn’t work in the theater.""

While LaBeouf struggled to get along with Baldwin at the time, he told THR that other A-list stars were there for him when he needed to make a change, naming Mel Gibson as someone who has ""always been very lovely"" to him.
""He held my hand when I was really s----ing on myself,"" he recalled. ""Dude really stepped up for me in big ways. Him, Sean Penn, James Brolin — these guys got me to sobriety. They got around me and kept me alive.""

LaBeouf briefly acknowledged the public perception of him after years of controversy that included former girlfriend FKA Twigs filing a lawsuit against him in 2020 for the alleged abuse she suffered during their relationship. The lawsuit is ongoing, and he has denied the allegations, but he said that he understands there is ""all this myth already about how I’m a dog-killing, monstrous piece of s--t.""
Now, he is interested in rehabilitation.

Country music star Jelly Roll is no stranger to personal battles.
The ""Save Me"" singer recently admitted the biggest challenge he faced during his weight-loss journey after he shed nearly 200 pounds.
""Food, man,"" Jelly Roll told Fox News Digital at the 2025 Academy of Country Music Awards on Thursday.

For the country star, the weight loss wasn't just about his fitness, but a constant struggle with his relationship with food.
""If you're really battling obesity, you got to start at the dinner table, man. The walking's great, all the other stuff's great, but you got to fight that addiction at the dinner table,"" he said.

Jelly Roll has been consistent in his efforts to lose weight, confessing he was addicted to food in the same way that he was previously addicted to drugs.
""The battle was with the food addiction, changing the way I’ve looked at food for the last 39 years,"" he told People magazine last year. ""I’ve never had a healthy relationship with food, so that was the hard part. But once you get into that discipline and commitment, it’s like an avalanche. Once that little snowball started rolling, it was on its way.""

""We just passed the halfway point of the tour, and Jelly’s been crushing it,"" his trainer said. ""We’re either walking [around] the arena, playing basketball, boxing. He just surpassed his 100-pound weight loss.""

While at the 2025 ACM Awards, Jelly Roll also told Fox News Digital about how the country music community has changed his life.
""I am struggling to walk around the carpet because I have built so many relationships in this genre,"" he said. ""I mean, I'm hugging camera guys… I am looking at Cody Johnson… publishers… the Dallas station that gave me one of my first interviews ever on a radio station… I'm overwhelmed. I'm overwhelmed, to be honest.""

""You know, I'll give you perspective… I'm talkin' too much, but it's the truth. I've stayed at the same hotel all three ACMs. And it has been interesting to just watch how much just staying at that hotel has changed for me… how many more friends come by,"" Jelly Roll said.
""I remember last year, me and Jason Aldean pretty much became friends by staying next to each other and just hung out all night,"" he said.

Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider left Los Angeles for the ""open roads"" of North Carolina years ago and never looked back.
Snider, now 70, and his wife chose to uproot their family for a life they never had after moving to Los Angeles in 2015.
""We moved out to LA 10 years ago, the whole family. A couple of years ago, everybody was sitting around saying, you know, it's time to get back to a calmer life, not 'back to' – to a life we never had,"" Snider explained to WFMY News.
""We literally looked from the West Coast to the East Coast and slowly started dialing in,"" he added. ""And North Carolina took the number one spot ... You've got to come for the state. So the entire family came out, this is true, and we started on the west end of the state, and we just visited towns. We traveled all the way to the shoreline. And people were amazing, and that's ultimately what it came down to.""

""She turned up to our show on her cousin's ID and thought she was seeing a girl band,"" the singer previously told The Sydney Morning Herald. ""I saw her and flipped. She was this hot Italian beauty. I told her I'd be famous one day. We've been together ever since.""
Suzette became the band's costume designer and even designed their logo. The two share four kids together; Jesse, 42, Shane, 37, and Cody, 35, and Cheyenne, 28.

Snider has found the best part of North Carolina's rural lifestyle is the ""open roads.""
""I like cars. The roads here are great. I'm also a motorcycle rider,"" he told the local North Carolina station. ""So, I mean, in LA or New York, where I'm from originally, it's just defensive riding 'don't hit me!' But here, you can get up, and you can just get out on the open roads and just really enjoy the beauty of the state and enjoy riding and driving.""
""You notice I'm limping – it's because I was bike trail riding and the trail won the other day. I took a spill. Sometimes the trail wins.""

The ""9 to 5"" crooner revealed why she has turned down offers to sit on the judging panel for the popular singing competition shows.

Hilaria Baldwin is seemingly calling out Amy Schumer after she previously threw a comedic jab at her Spanish roots.
In her new book, ""Manual Not Included,"" Baldwin opened up about the emotional toll of being the target of jokes that questioned her identity and heritage.
Although the wife of Alec Baldwin did not mention Schumer’s name, she wrote about a ""famous person, someone I’ve never met, who said nasty and untrue things about me and my family"" in excerpts obtained by People.

""We didn’t engage with her and I guess I am proud of that,"" she penned. ""It made me mad at the system, but here, in this book, is where I can talk about it. I don’t need to use her name, and I don’t want any problems with her…""

Baldwin revealed that the public scrutiny surrounding the scandal left her physically ill with stress. The mother-of-eight also claimed her kids were brought to tears over the controversial commentary.
""It gutted me because I couldn’t understand how someone could be so inherently cruel,"" she wrote. ""I don’t need an apology… No matter what, I hope I never meet her.""

""I’m saying it wrong. I’m sorry,"" she said before adopting a Spanish accent to repeat Baldwin's name.

""So, I just can’t wrap my head around this story,"" Schumer said in the special. ""If you don't know who I mean, this is Alec Baldwin's wife.""
Schumer recalled meeting Hilaria ""years ago"" backstage at ""Saturday Night Live."" When Alec attempted to introduce his wife to the comedian, Schumer said, ""I saw her and I said, 'No, thank you.'""
Amy Schumer said in a 2023 comedy special that Hilaria Baldwin ""is actually Hillary from Boston."" (Nathan Congleton)
She added, ""I'm trying to hang on to my self-esteem, OK. She is a tiny Disney princess and I look like Ben Roethlisberger from most angles.""
Schumer remembered Hilaria having a ""very thick, Spanish accent, from Spain.""
""They have a von Trapp amount of children, and they named them all ― I’m not sure, but very Spanish names like Jamón, Croqueta and Flamenco, you know. And all of this would be fine and beautiful, except that ‘Hilaria from España’ is actually Hillary from Boston.""
The Baldwins share eight small children together – Carmen, 11, Rafael, 9, Leonardo, 8, Romeo, 6, Eduardo, 4, María Lucía, 4, and Ilaria, 2. The couple welcomed María Lucía via surrogacy five months after the birth of Eduardo. Hilaria chose to do surrogacy after she miscarried one embryo following in vitro fertilization.

Baldwin claimed she was born in Mallorca and raised in Boston. She said on a podcast in April 2020 that she moved to the U.S. when she was 19 years old to attend NYU.
She has since apologized for the confusion and admitted in an Instagram post at the time that ""culture, languages, sexual orientations, religions [and] political beliefs"" are ""allow[ed] to be fluid.""
Meanwhile, Schumer criticized Baldwin in her comedy special, saying, ""My point is that all evidence points to this woman, since she met her husband, has straight up pretended to be from Spain. And her husband shot someone … now stay with me.""

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs added high-profile criminal defense lawyer Brian Steel to his team in the weeks prior to his sex-trafficking trial.
Steel filed a notice that he was joining the music mogul's defense on April 15, just weeks before the rapper appeared for the first time in front of potential jurors on May 5.
Diddy has been charged with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution in a federal indictment unsealed Sept. 17. Diddy has maintained his innocence. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Authorities alleged Diddy ran a criminal enterprise through his businesses, including Bad Boy Entertainment, Combs Enterprises and Combs Global, among others. He used ""firearms, threats of violence, coercion and verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse"" to fulfill his sexual desires, according to prosecutors.
Here's what to know about Georgia powerhouse, Brian Steel.

The Atlanta-based lawyer was added to Diddy's team on April 15.
He joined Marc Agnifilo, Teny Geragos, Alexandra A.E. Shapiro, Anna Estevao, Jason Driscoll, Xavier Donaldson and Nicole Westmoreland.
Steel is one of the last-minute additions to the team. Donaldson was added May 2, while Westmoreland was added May 7.
Celebrity attorney Mark Geragos will assist Combs’ legal team throughout the trial in an unofficial role, a source told Fox News Digital.

Steel began his career as a tax attorney at Price Waterhouse after graduating from Fordham University School of Law.
He has appeared in courts in many states besides Georgia, including California, Florida, Missouri, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon and now New York.
His clients' alleged crimes have ranged from RICO, wire fraud, immigration fraud and money laundering to murder, armed robbery, drug offenses, rape and child sex offenses.

The attorney defending Diddy on charges that stem from lavish parties filled with alcohol actually leads a clean lifestyle.
""Brian doesn’t drink, doesn’t smoke and can’t believe anybody would,"" lawyer David Botts told the New Yorker. ""He won’t curse, even in court, even if he’s reading from a transcript. So when he’s cross-examining, he’ll say, ‘So-and-so F-word.’ The court will say, ‘Mr. Steel, you can read that word.’ But Brian still won’t do it.""
""Brian only drinks water,"" said the attorney, who has known Steel for more than 30 years. ""His lunch is tofu or salmon, maybe, and a salad. No bread. I’ve never seen him eat out. And he’ll bring a toothbrush to court. A toothbrush! He exercises daily, before or after court. Running. Swimming. Weights. And he’s got a great family, three kids, a wonderful wife, Colette, who is also his law partner. They kind of idolize each other.""
Steel and his wife began their law firm together in 1997.

Steel likely caught Combs' eye after defending Young Thug in the YSL trial.
Young Thug was indicted under Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) in 2022 as authorities claimed he used his music label YSL as cover for a violent gang.
""Brian is a legend, especially after YSL,"" Douglas Weinstein, who represented one of Young Thug's co-defendants, told Rolling Stone. ""His insights, tenacity and character will be a phenomenal addition to Mr. Combs' team. I saw it in person during the YSL trial. I wish I could be a fly on the wall with whatever happens. He's a legend in Georgia.""

The RICO trial ended up lasting nearly two years. While Steel was ready to defend the rapper until the end, Young Thug chose to accept a plea deal in October 2024. He was sentenced to time served and 15 years of probation.
However, he has some regrets: ""I shoulda listened to you,"" he told Steel during an interview with the New Yorker.
""The worldwide tours and money that’s being thrown at him now,"" Steel explained. ""It was good before. Now it’s next level. People realize what he did; in my opinion, he unmasked the truth that the criminal-justice system is broken.""
Following the conclusion of Young Thug's trial, Steel became somewhat of a celebrity himself. He posed for a photo shoot for Young Thug's clothing label, SP5DER, and rapper Drake titled a song after him.
""Yeah, shout Brian Steel, take off the cuffs,"" Drake rapped in the song, which doesn't seem to be about the lawyer specifically but about freedom. ""We leavin’ now.""

The lawyer has spent 30 years defending people accused of criminal conduct.
""The more challenging the case is, the more likely I’ll take it,"" Steel told the New Yorker. ""Do I like the person I’m defending? That’s the main thing.""
When asked if he'd have chosen to represent the late Jeffrey Epstein in his sex-trafficking trial, he told the outlet, ""I’d have to understand better all the facts and circumstances.""
""See, I don’t believe allegations,"" he explained. ""I go into it believing the person is innocent.""

After Prince Harry’s latest explosive interview, Prince William is committed more than ever to protecting his children from an heir-and-spare nightmare.
The claim was made by British royals expert Hilary Fordwich, who believes that Harry’s struggles with being a royal ""spare"" have not only been a ""nightmare"" for the senior royals today but serve as a cautionary tale for the future of the monarchy.
""Prince William is particularly determined to do all he can to avoid the ‘heir and spare,’ which has caused so many royal nightmares [over] the generations,"" Fordwich explained.

""He and Princess Catherine are focused on the importance of ‘normal’ simple childhood moments, such as family chores together, cooking, family holidays, sports and time in nature. They are keen on country walks and bonfires, very British traditions.""
The rift between the Duke of Sussex and his family burst into the open again last week when the prince gave a raw interview to the BBC after losing a court case over his security. In a long and at times emotional conversation, the 40-year-old said he wants reconciliation, while re-airing grievances against the royal family, the U.K. government and the media.

""This, at the heart of it, is a family dispute,"" he said.
Harry has been estranged from his family since he and his wife, Meghan Markle, quit royal duties in 2020 and moved to the United States, alleging hostility and racist attitudes by the press and royal establishment. Harry’s tell-all 2023 memoir ""Spare,"" filled with private details about embarrassing revelations, made things worse.

Harry’s latest interview took place on May 2nd, the same day when William’s middle child, Princess Charlotte, turned 10 years old. His eldest son, Prince George, 11, is second in line to the British throne.

""Princess Catherine [like William] is determined to raise Princess Charlotte with a combination of adherence to traditional royal values of duty and public service, as well as a close-knit, loving, nurturing approach in the hopes of avoiding [another] royal ‘spare,’ such as her wayward uncle,"" said Fordwich.
Fordwich’s sentiments came shortly after People magazine published a cover story to commemorate Charlotte’s birthday. In the issue, royal experts pointed out how Charlotte being the spare to her brother is in ""a vulnerable place"" and filled with potential pitfalls that Harry experienced on the world stage.

""That’s why she had a particular soft spot for [her sister, Princess] Margaret, for [her son, Prince] Andrew, and [her grandson,] Harry,"" he shared. ""She understood that being second place in a strictly hierarchical family and institution has its challenges. Everyone is conscious of that.""
In ""Spare,"" Harry detailed his sibling rivalry with William, 42, and how he struggled to find his way behind palace doors.

Harry also described that being the spare led to tensions with his brother.
""My family had declared me a nullity. The spare,"" he wrote. ""I didn’t complain about it, but I didn’t need to dwell on it either. Far better, in my mind, not to think about certain facts... But no one gave a damn whom I traveled with; the spare could always be spared.""

""Prince William and Princess Catherine know only too well the perils of the heir-and-spare relationship dynamic,"" British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital.
""We know of numerous heir-and-spare cycles, the spare going slightly off the rails, usually due to feeling undervalued,"" she shared.
Chard pointed out prime examples of ""royal rebels"" who sparked furious backlash due to their actions included Margaret, Andrew and, more recently, Harry.

""The Prince and Princess of Wales are taking every step, a conscious decision to prevent the heir-and-spare cycle with their children,"" Chard explained. ""They are well aware of the pitfalls Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis could face growing up with Prince George.""
""The Prince and Princess of Wales know their minds and are carving out their royal path,"" Chard continued. ""They are not afraid to tweak and change the traditional royal ways and rules. They prioritize their family. Their children come first. The children are given the love, support and guidance needed for a balanced, successful, healthy future. They are aware their parenting decisions are critical to the success of the crown.""

""The Princess Royal has taken Princess Charlotte under her wing,"" Chard claimed. ""They have a close bond. Princess Anne is a fabulous role model for Charlotte. She is aware of the trials and tribulations of being the right-hand woman to her brother, King Charles. She steers Charlotte in the happy direction of being the great support, right-hand woman to her brother, future heir Prince George.""
""I feel Princess Charlotte in the future could fulfill the role currently held by Princess Anne, becoming the backbone of royal appearances and duties,"" royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital. ""Princess Anne is seen as the hardest-working royal, and Charlotte right now seems to have the same steely resolve to do things correctly.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/randy-travis-stages-stunning-comeback-help-from-ai-after-devastating-stroke","Randy Travis stages stunning comeback with help from AI after devastating stroke","Randy Travis and his wife Mary spoke with Fox News Digital at the ACMs last week about the AI technology that helped recreate Travis’ voice after he suffered a stroke and why they hope people can see the good in its usage.
Randy Travis is leaning into artificial intelligence (AI) to continue to produce new music, over a decade after his near-fatal stroke.
In 2013, Travis' stroke left him with aphasia – which is the loss of ability to understand or express speech.
With the help of AI and country musician James Dupré, Travis was able to produce two new songs since his stroke, ""Where That Came From"" in 2024 and now his latest single, ""Horses in Heaven."" He has been on his ""More Life Tour"" since last spring and recently extended dates through fall 2025.

Randy's wife, Mary Travis, joined him for an interview with Garden & Gun to explain how her husband used AI for new music.
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
""People think you just plug it in a computer and it spits out a song and there’s no creativity. That could not be farther from the truth. It took eleven months. In the time most people make an album, we did one song,"" she told the outlet.
WATCH: Randy Travis and his wife Mary call AI ‘magical’ for giving him back his voice
""Kyle Lehning, Randy’s longtime producer, sent the raw vocals of about 45 of Randy’s songs to London, where they were put into the model using a vocal line provided by country music singer James Dupré. They were able to pick the voice stems of Randy’s songs and lay them over the vocal line.
""When it came back from London, Kyle and Randy worked their magic in the studio to perfect the song, tweaking it to make sure that his tone, his inflections, everything was like what Randy would sing. When we finally heard the result, we knew it was worth it,"" Mary said.

She added, ""Hopefully it will set a precedent for what AI is used for.""
Thanks to AI, Travis was able to go back on tour. Dupré has been on tour with him, assisting as a special guest vocalist on the music legend's ""More Life Tour,"" which kicked off last spring.

When Garden & Gun asked Randy how excited he was about extending his tour, he smiled and said, ""Just a lot. Yeah.""
Mary added, ""He loves being with his fans. He loves the energy of the stage. People always ask if it’s hard for him to hear his music played by somebody else. I think for some people it would be, but for Randy, he’s like, No, I’m good with that. Music belongs to all of us.""
Randy Travis' wife Mary said AI has been ""wonderful"" for her husband. (Theo Wargo/WireImage)
Mary told the outlet that AI has been ""wonderful"" for her husband.
""In 2013, that was not anything we could have perceived on the horizon. AI has come up so fast and furiously. When we were approached by Cris Lacy at Warner about it, it was exciting. I wanted to hear that voice more than anything — I have for 12 years now.
""Randy’s always been very much a pioneer in music. When you think about the Toby Keith song, ‘Don’t Let the Old Man In,’ that’s Randy Travis. He’s not letting the old man in. He’s gonna keep thinking of what we can do to make a difference,"" she told the outlet.

In 2023, Randy and Mary spoke with Fox News Digital about his condition ahead of a tribute concert, which also raised money for the Randy Travis Foundation. The foundation focuses on stroke and aphasia awareness and supporting music education in schools.
""We want people to understand strokes, stroke rehabilitation, that there is life after stroke,"" Mary said at the time. ""We did find that all of the rehab that we went through, life is the best rehab. Just get out there. Go do what you used to do. You know, the world may wonder why you're out here, but just go out there and, you know, dance like nobody's watching and sing like nobody's listening and just have a good time. It truly is the best therapy.""

Mary also cited her and Randy’s faith for helping them work through recovery.

""He's very faithful,"" she said. ""We, you know, we leaned hard on God. It's been 10 years now since the stroke, and that's hard to believe. … There's really no words for it, and there's not a day that goes by that I just don't thank God for his grace and his mercy.""

Gottlieb noted that both parties will have ""an opportunity to ask Ms. Lively questions"" during the discovery process. ""We think there have been a lot of distractions put up to deflect attention from the retaliation campaign that was launched against her,"" he said. ""And we expect and hope that in discovery we'll have an opportunity to really focus on what we believe to be the core part of the case, which is that this retaliation campaign was launched against Ms. Lively for her having raised concerns about sexual harassment.""
Baldoni's legal team stood firm in their defense, and noted in a statement provided to Fox News Digital, ""Although obviously uncomfortable for the Lively parties, the truth is not a distraction.""

""The truth has been clearly shown through unedited receipts, documents and real life footage. More to come,"" his attorney, Bryan Freedman, said. ""Blake was the one who brought her high profile friends into this situation without concern for their own personal or public backlash. As the truth shows, she used her Dragons to manipulate Justin at every turn.""
He continued of Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds: ""Ryan’s involvement is very well documented and we continue to discover more intentional misconduct. Was Disney actually complicit in Ryan using shareholder revenues to further a personal grudge? I would be surprised to learn that this type of corporate waste would not lead to much more exposure for those that have been complicit in affecting shareholder revenue.""
BLAKE LIVELY LANDING ON TIME100 ‘TITAN’ LIST SPARKS BACKLASH, CALLED AN ‘INSULT’
Baldoni mentioned Taylor Swift in his lawsuit by sharing texts exchanged between him and Lively. The ""Jane the Virgin"" star claimed Lively used her friendship with Swift to threaten him into changing the ""It Ends With Us"" script. While working on the film, Lively insisted on rewriting the rooftop scene. Baldoni had been hesitant about the idea but told Lively he would ""take a look at what she put together,"" according to the complaint.

Afterward, Lively invited Baldoni to her New York City home, where the actor-director said he felt Swift and Reynolds pressured him into using Lively's rewrite of the scene. ""Later, Baldoni felt obliged to text Lively to say that he had liked her pages and hadn’t needed Reynolds and her megacelebrity friend to pressure him,"" the complaint said.
""I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor [emoji] You really are a talent across the board. Really excited nd (sic) grateful to do this together,"" Baldoni's text said, according to the complaint.
Lively shared a lengthy response in which she referred to Swift and Reynolds as ""dragons"" who protect her.

Lively detailed allegations of sexual harassment, retaliation, intentional affliction of emotional distress, negligence and more made by Baldoni and lead producer Jamie Heath in a complaint first filed with the California Civil Rights department on Dec. 20 and later in federal court on Dec. 31.

The same day Lively filed her federal suit, Baldoni filed a $250 million suit against The New York Times for a December article about the alleged smear campaign he attempted to run against his co-star.
Weeks later, Baldoni then named Lively and Reynolds in a separate $400 million defamation lawsuit in which he accused the Hollywood power couple of attempting to hijack ""It Ends With Us"" and create their own narrative.

Jon Voight is taking his role as special ambassador for Hollywood seriously.
The ""National Treasure"" star met with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida over the weekend just before the president announced 100% tariffs on filming overseas.
""It’s come to a point where we really do need help, and thank God the president cares about Hollywood and movies,"" Voight told Variety this week. ""He has a great love for Hollywood in that way. We’ve got to roll up our sleeves here. We can’t let it go down the drain like Detroit.""
Trump appointed Voight along with Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone as Hollywood ambassadors in January soon after taking office, referring to it as a ""great but very troubled place.""

""They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK—BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!"" he wrote on Truth Social at the time. ""These three very talented people will be my eyes and ears, and I will get done what they suggest. It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!""
Voight told Variety the goal was to ""give people back their dignity and their jobs,"" without going into specifics about the plan, adding, ""Something has to be done, and it’s way past time.""
Although some in the industry have reacted negatively to the tariffs proposal, Voight said he’s been getting positive feedback.

""We’ve gotten a lot of good response from people,"" he added. ""We’re really rolling up our sleeves and working. I think we have a good plan, and we’re just beginning. This little team of mine has worked very hard to try to figure out things. The union people and producers give their expertise and understanding to this problem, and we’re working together. A lot of people had a lot of input and we’re listening to everybody.""
Voight said the studios have taken advantage of financial incentives to shoot abroad.

""Every studio has a lot of smart people, and they have maneuvered the write-offs and the gifts that are being given out throughout the world to lure people to different countries,"" he told Variety. ""They take advantage of them. Now we’re saying, ‘Hey, we have to have that here.’ Let’s have the level playing field. But really, we need more than that. We need to be competitive.""

Voight also said he thinks that both he and Trump have been treated unfairly by those in the industry who lean left.
""But what’s the difference? Who cares?"" he said. ""I mean, there’s been a battle, but now it’s time to put that aside. And I must say, in all of the interactions we’ve had [on addressing runaway production], politics has never come up. Never.""

At age 71, Christie Brinkley still feels like an ""Uptown Girl.""
The former Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model has written a memoir, ""Uptown Girl,"" which explores her rise to stardom and the pitfalls she faced.
During her ""FOX & Friends"" appearance on Thursday, the star was asked how she’s stayed in camera-ready shape over the years. And Brinkley didn’t hesitate to share her diet regimen.

""First of all, my number one beauty secret is that I have been a vegetarian since I was a little kid,"" said Brinkley. ""And I really, truly believe that if everybody would at least try and be a vegetarian or a vegan… I’m currently a vegan. I have been for the past, maybe a year now.""
""So try it,"" she encouraged viewers. ""You’ll love it. And you’ll never feel better. And you’ll be helping our planet, which is vitally important right now.""
The model previously told Fox News Digital she’s a big fan of the ""rainbow diet,"" or ""brightly colored foods"" rich in vitamins and minerals.

""It fortifies my body — and you really, truly are what you eat,"" she shared. ""I treat myself to good nutrition, and I never feel like I’m denying myself.""
""It’s no longer called a diet,"" Brinkley stressed. ""There’s no denying myself anything… I’ve always said, the more you learn about food, vitamins, minerals and exercise and what it does to your body chemistry, the more you will reach for the good stuff because you’ll want to fuel your body. And that’s what I do.""

Back in her early modeling years, Brinkley was put on an all-fish diet to shed pounds quickly before a photoshoot. These days, Brinkley said she refuses to deny herself the foods she loves. Moderation is key, she said.

""If I happen to be on some trip, or it’s somebody’s birthday, you have to have a piece of cake because it’s not good luck to not take a bite of the birthday cake,"" she chuckled. ""I do that, and then I say, ‘That’s fine.’ I’m not going to beat myself up over it. I’ll just watch the sugar intake the rest of the day, but I just want to treat my body right.""
""I've been a lifelong vegetarian,"" said Brinkley. ""But about a year ago, I became a vegan, and I am really, really thrilled that I did, because I have never felt better. I eat lots of grains and beans and all kinds of colorful foods.""

""Slow down, you crazy child, you’re so ambitious for a juvenile,"" she sang. ""But seriously, slow down. Enjoy it all. Savor it all. But live.""
Back in 2021, Brinkley told Fox News Digital she won’t step on a scale to manage her weight. Instead, she lets her clothes do the talking.
""I don’t step on a scale,"" she said at the time. ""I have my ‘Honest Jeans’ tell me the truth. I’ll try those on to see where I’m at. If I fit into those, I feel good. And when they’re too tight, it’s OK, too.""

""At first, I was a little surprised because I’ve been wearing a lot of sweatpants,"" she added. But for me, it’s smaller portions and a little more exercise. And I choose to focus on counting my blessings, because once you start realizing all the things in your life that you’re grateful for, it becomes no big whoop.""
In 2019, Brinkley told Fox News Digital that keeping her body moving has been essential over the years.
""I’ve always loved sports and doing things outdoors,"" she said. ""Whether it’s running around the tennis court, stand-up paddleboarding, skiing, kayaking, cycling, mountain trails — I just love being active and doing things.""

That’s the worst thing you can do. You gotta get yourself to a physical therapist, figure out what’s causing those aches and pains, strengthen your muscles and keep going.""

Mandy Moore called out Los Angeles County over the ""meaningless protocol"" preventing communities from rebuilding after fires destroyed thousands of structures in January.
The ""This Is Us"" star has found it ""impossible"" to rebuild her home.
""Thanks, LA County for making it as frustrating and impossible to rebuild after the fires as possible,"" Moore wrote in an Instagram story on Tuesday, according to Us Weekly. ""Shouldn’t be surprised but it’s mind boggling the red tape and hoops they’re putting us all through.""
""It’s maddening and heartless … the endless hoops and meaningless protocol LA County is asking of fire victims who want to rebuild and get their lives back,"" she added. ""Wasn’t California going to make this as easy as possible?""

Mandy Moore called out LA County in posts shared on Instagram. (Mandy Moore/Instagram)
""We JUST finished building one of the structures that burned down [this past] November. We have all the plans and permits ready to go and we were just told we have to resubmit everything and start over,"" she explained. ""For no reason.

Jennifer Aniston's suspected stalker, Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, was ordered by a Los Angeles County judge to stay at least 100 yards away from the actress during a court appearance Thursday.
Carwyle, 48, appeared shirtless and wrapped in a blanket when he appeared behind glass in a custody area of a Los Angeles courtroom. The Mississippi man did not enter a plea or speak at all. Aniston’s suspected stalker was not granted bail at the preliminary hearing, and was ordered to go through mental-health court to determine whether he is competent to face felony stalking and vandalism charges.

Carwyle began sending the ""Friends"" star unwanted social media, voicemail and email messages in March 2023, according to prosecutors. Judge Keith L. Schwartz doubted whether Carwyle would understand him when a prosecutor requested that the defendant, who will remain in jail, be ordered not to get near Aniston.
Carwyle's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Toral Malik, said, ""I don’t believe him staying away from Ms. Aniston will be an issue at this time.""
But at a prosecutors' insistence, Schwartz issued the order anyway.
The Los Angeles judge said, ""You are not to have any contact with Jennifer Aniston under any conditions.""

Aniston’s alleged stalker claimed on social media that he and the Hollywood actress were married, but corruption kept them apart, according to NBC.
He’s reportedly been living out of his PT Cruiser in a Walmart parking lot in Los Angeles for several months.
Fox News has learned that Carwyle is an auto mechanic. His friends have expressed concern that he’s having a ""mental breakdown.""

""Stalking is a crime that can quickly escalate from harassment to dangerous, violent actions, threatening the safety of victims and our communities,"" Hochman said in a statement. ""My office is committed to aggressively prosecuting those who stalk and terrorize others, ensuring they are held accountable.""
Carwyle was charged with one count of felony stalking and one count of felony vandalism with an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm.
Aniston's private security detained Carwyle until Los Angeles Police officers arrested him Monday.
He is accused of ""repeatedly harassing"" the ""Friends"" star with unwanted social media, email and phone messages, starting in March until the day of the crash, according to the DA's office.
His arraignment is scheduled for Thursday, where prosecutors will request his bail be set at $150,000, the DA's office said.

He talked about the impact they have had on the industry and his future plans to retire.
Smokey Robinson is firmly denying the sexual assault allegations made against him.
Robinson’s attorney, Christopher Frost, released a statement on behalf of his client, to Fox News Digital, suggesting that the claims are a tactic to extort money from the Motown legend, as he pointed to inconsistencies and questionable timelines in the plaintiffs' accounts.
Robinson's wife of 25 years, Frances, was also accused of perpetuating a ""hostile work environment.""

""As this case progresses, the evidence (the crucial element that guides us) will show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon--$50 million dollars, to be exact.""
Robinson, 85, was accused of sexual misconduct and false imprisonment Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by four anonymous former employees, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.

The accusers claimed Frances ""failed to take the appropriate corrective action to prevent Defendant Smokey Robinson’s deviant misconduct"" despite having ""full knowledge of his prior acts of sexual misconduct, having settled cases with other women that suffered and experienced similar sexual assaults perpetuated by him.""
According to the lawsuit, one of the four accusers, Jane Doe 1 worked for the Motown legend from January 2023 through February 2024 but was forced to resign due to Robinson's ""repeated sexual assaults and sexual harassment against her.""

David and Victoria Beckham are reportedly ""disappointed"" in son Brooklyn Beckham's decision not to attend any of his father's 50th birthday celebrations, and the hurt could be causing a family rift.
""There are tensions between Brooklyn and [wife] Nicola [Peltz] and the family,"" a source told People. ""The relationship is definitely not beyond repair. They love and are always there for him. They’re just hurt and disappointed that he’s now playing no part in family life.""
Representatives for Victoria and David did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Last weekend, Victoria took to social media to share a series of photos from her husband's birthday festivities, including an intimate dinner and a Paris excursion.
""Creating special memories with family and friends. We love you all,"" Victoria, who tagged her three other children, Romeo, 22, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 13, wrote. None of the photos featured Brooklyn or Nicola.
On Saturday, friends including Eva Longoria, Gordon Ramsay, Tom Cruise and more gathered at London’s Core restaurant to celebrate the milestone. Brooklyn seemed to have missed this event as well.

While it's unclear why the 26-year-old was not in attendance for any of his father's celebrations, rumors of a feud between his wife and Victoria have been swirling since Brooklyn married Nicola in April 2022. Fans noticed that Nicola had chosen not to share any photos of Brooklyn's family from the wedding on social media, and rumors were further fueled by the fact that she hadn't worn a wedding dress designed by Victoria.

When addressing the feud rumors in August that year, Brooklyn told Variety that everything being written about his mom and Nicola taught him the media is ""always going to try and put people down,"" but what is important is that ""everyone gets along, which is good.""
In 2023, Nicola told Cosmopolitan, ""I’ve said this so many times: There’s no feud. I don’t know. No one ever wants to write the nice things. It’s really weird, actually, whether it’s my life or someone else’s life or whatever, when you know the truth, and then you read something totally wrong.""

Amid the chaos, David took time to reflect on his 50 years of life.
""As I reflect on this Birthday I'm very grateful for many things in my life the teams I've played for, my teammates, managers, the fans, MY COUNTRY and being England captain, the children I have met over different charities I work with, my team in my business & the friends I have around me I feel truly blessed,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""But my biggest accomplishment is and will always be my family.""

He continued, ""My mum and dad who sacrificed so much for me to live my dream of becoming a footballer, my sisters who had to put up with following their brother around in the freezing cold watching me play football and my amazing nan and grandad... My wife and best friend of 28 years and my beautiful children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz & Harper you are the reason I get out of bed each day.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/country-icon-gretchen-wilson-wins-masked-singer-after-major-step-back-from-spotlight","Country star Gretchen Wilson wins 'Masked Singer' after 'severe' COVID symptoms kept her from spotlight","Country star Gretchen Wilson told Fox News Digital that she is still dealing with symptoms from COVID years after being infected.
Country music icon of the '90s Gretchen Wilson won big on Fox’s ""The Masked Singer"" after health concerns and her personality kept her out of the public eye, according to the star.
During an interview with Fox News Digital, Wilson shared the reason why she has been on a hiatus from Hollywood.
""So, I got COVID. I was one of the very first to get it, and it was a heck of a round. It left me with high blood pressure, shortness of breath, asthma – all of which I still have – and it took about two years for me to find the right doctors, cardiologists to get it all sorted, to find the right medicine to get my blood pressure down. I mean, it was pretty severe. It was bad enough that I couldn't even do light housework without the blood pressure going up to scary levels,"" Wilson exclusively told Fox News Digital.

COVID was not Wilson's only health battle in recent years.
""I also shattered my leg, and I was in a wheelchair for eight months. So there was a lot that I had to work through.""
""So I just stayed away, figured it out. Like I said, it took a long time, but I finally got myself into a place where I was like, 'Okay, I feel like I'm back.'""
The ""Redneck Woman"" singer also shared that it is not her personality to share her highs and lows on social media.
""I don't get on my phone and go, ‘Oh, woe is me and look at me and I am so sad, boohoo.’ It's just not my personality. So I just stayed away, figured it out. Like I said, it took a long time, but I finally got myself into a place where I was like, 'Okay, I feel like I'm back,'"" Wilson said.

When Wilson got the call to compete on ""The Masked Singer,"" she decided to use it as an opportunity to see if her talents were still there.
""When they called and asked – to me, it was like the best, I don't know of a better opportunity for me to go and try to just see ‘What do I have? Do I have it or is it over, you know?’ And it was hard work, but it was so rewarding.
""I gotta say that I don't think I have this kind of pride or this much just, you know, want to if I hadn't done the show. The show really proved to me that I can still do it, that I need to still be doing it and that I want to still be doing it,"" she said, referring to singing and performing.

""I take two different inhalers every day and I take a pretty massive beta blocker. So, I've got my tools. No, I don't think that I felt any different during the show than I do with my typical touring gigs. It's probably a little bit harder to do the 75- to 90-minute nonstop, middle of July, Yuma, Arizona show. That's probably a little bit harder than any given one day on the show. I will say that it's enough work that I felt like I got dehydrated a couple of times. It was a lot of work just keeping hydrated,"" Wilson said.
Now that Wilson is getting back into the spotlight, she has been working with ""Yellowstone"" creator Taylor Sheridan, Blake Shelton and Keith Urban.

She told Fox News Digital that she had talked to Sheridan about appearing in one of his many shows.
""I don't know, we talked a little bit, we were working, so obviously we didn't sit around and just shoot the cr-p. I would like to, pick his brain, who wouldn't, but we were pretty focused on the project at hand. I have no idea, I think that's gonna be up to Taylor. He's got so many different irons in the fire. He's [got] what, five, 10 different shows going all the time,"" Wilson said.
Wilson felt ""very comfortable"" working with Shelton and Urban – who are polar opposites, according to the singer.

""Blake's just always having a good time. He's Mr. Funny. I think that if things hadn't worked out so well for him in this industry, he could have very easily been a comedian.
""And Keith is just a lot more serious, but man, what a guy. I mean every time I'm around him, I'm just like, man, when I grew up, I wanted to be Keith Urban. He's brilliant. He's so talented. He played every night. He played every on this other show that I did and just aces every night, perfect voice, so healthy. Takes care of himself. Yeah, I want to be like that. You know, I told him, I said, ‘You make me want to be a better me, Keith, you really do.’ And then I looked at Blake and said, 'Yeah, not so much you,"" Wilson said while laughing.

And I'm really glad I did it. Like it was, it was freeing. Creatively, I kind of felt like I recalibrated my whole system and my whole mindset,"" Kelley told Fox News Digital.

""Going into it, I knew it was gonna be fun and wacky and wild and just like a good time and theatrical and just wild production and stuff. But I didn't know that I was gonna leave with just a different headspace, man. I just felt like I was able to double down on just being myself and going forward not worrying about anything, man, and it was so good for me. It was just like. In that mask, in that suit, and just like, ‘Hey, let it rip, have fun.’ Singing all sorts of songs, different genres, and just singing like here's my take on how I would do that song or how I'd do this song and just be myself,"" Kelley said.

Reba McEntire and Rex Linn's mutual love for ""the cowboy way of life"" created a ""perfect union"" for the two.
McEntire, who is set to host the Academy of Country Music Awards on Thursday, opened up about her relationship with the actor while walking the red carpet ahead of the biggest nights in country music.
""Well, Rex and I get along in every aspect,"" the singer-actress told Fox News Digital about why their romance works. ""He's a better cook than I am, so I like that, for sure. We love Longhorns, we love the cowboy way of life, cowgirl way of life, and we both got into the entertainment industry.""
""He's an actor. I'm a singer. I love to act. Now we act together,"" she added. ""So it's just the perfect union, absolutely. And we get along great. We do argue now. We argue a lot, but we have fun doing that too.""

As for whether the two will ever get married, McEntire said, ""you never know. Absolutely, hope so one day.""
McEntire and Linn have been friends since 1991, but their relationship didn't turn romantic until 2020. At the time, McEntire had guest starred on Linn's show ""Young Sheldon."" The two had to build their relationship virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We didn't get to see each other from January [2020] till June 16, but we created an intimacy by texting and talking over the telephone that we wouldn't have gotten if we'd have been together all of that time,"" McEntire previously told E! News. ""It was very special. It was a great way to find out about each other without ever touching.""
""We've been pretty much inseparable ever since June 16 of 2020,"" she explained.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/celebrity-lawyer-mark-geragos-steals-diddy-trial-spotlight-runs-trouble-judge","Celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos steals Diddy trial spotlight, runs into trouble with judge","Jury selection for Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' trial began on May 5. High-profile criminal defense lawyer Mark Geragos, father to Teny Geragos, who is an attorney on the rapper's legal team, was in court.
Mark Geragos is making a name for himself in the Sean ""Diddy"" Combs trial despite his minor affiliation with the defense team for the disgraced music mogul.
Geragos, 67, the criminal defense lawyer known for his roster of celebrity clients, was lectured in a Manhattan federal court this week after making statements about the case on a podcast.
During a conversation in the robing room after the jury selection process, Judge Arun Subramanian of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, reminded Geragos about a local rule limiting public statements made to the media, according to transcripts obtained by Fox News Digital.

""So we have an application from the government requesting that the Court remind Mr. Geragos and the defense team of their obligations pursuant to Local Rule 23.1,"" Subramanian said.
U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton submitted a letter Monday, which was obtained by Fox News Digital, requesting the court advise Geragos and Diddy's defense team to adhere to Local Rule 23.1.
The ruling states, ""[D]uring a jury trial of any criminal matter, including the period of selection of the jury, no lawyer or law firm associated with the … defense shall give or authorize any extrajudicial statement or interview relating to the trial or the parties or issues in the trial which a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if there is a substantial likelihood that such dissemination will interfere with a fair trial.""

""During the course of jury selection, despite the presence of seven defense attorneys who have filed notices of appearance in this case and a jury consultant, the defense team appeared to consult with Mark Geragos and other members of the Geragos & Geragos law firm who were present in court,"" the letter states.
Clayton noted Geragos' apparent ""long-standing relationship with the defendant"" before requesting the court to intervene under the rule to prevent concerns about trial publicity and ensure a fair trial is possible.

Subramanian continued in the closed-door meeting, ""So, Mr. Geragos, you understand that you are subject to Local Rule 23.1, yes?""
WATCH ON FOX NATION: WHAT DIDDY DO?
""I understand, arguably, that I am, yes,"" Geragos said before admitting he had ""real problems with the application"" of the rule but didn't want to waste time during the jury selection process.
The judge asked if Geragos was advising the defendant in any way, to which Geragos admitted that he speaks with Diddy ""with great frequency"" and is also representing his mother, Janice Combs.
Geragos affirmed that he was aware of the rule and was not trying to interfere with a fair trial in any way.

""Look, you understand that we're in the process of picking a jury,"" Subramanian said. ""Close to trial. And, you know, when you say things on a podcast like six women, all White, my understanding is you've got a six-pack of White women. Like that's not – that's something that you shouldn't – that no one should be saying as an officer of the court and a member of the bar, right?""

The judge was referring to the ""2 Angry Men"" podcast where Geragos and TMZ's Harvey Levin spitball Hollywood happenings, including the latest legal developments in celebrity cases.
""I think when you've got a Black man who's being prosecuted and the client feels like he's being targeted, it's a – it's an observation,"" Geragos said. ""I've also said things – said other things that I suppose could be brought up. But I will tell you that I haven't – I haven't attacked Mr. Wigdor or Lisa Bloom or any of the other people who are tangentially related and sitting in the government's route.""
Subramanian said, ""I think this is ridiculous. I think referring to the prosecution in this case as a six-pack of White women is outrageous. All right, and I understand what you're saying about the cases and everything else, but I think this is outrageous and this would not be tolerated in any court from any lawyer anywhere across the nation.
""And I'm going to be watching, and I'm going to be listening, all right? You have one more listener for your podcast.""

The Los Angeles-based attorney has worked on a number of high-profile cases.
Geragos and his team are now working toward a new trial or resentencing for the Menendez brothers. Lyle and Erik Menendez were convicted of killing their parents at their home in Beverly Hills in 1989 and were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
Geragos has said new evidence in the case proves the brothers were unfairly convicted, and in recent court filings, he requested to remove the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office from the case due to alleged bias.

He previously worked on Winona Ryder's 2001 shoplifting case and represented singer Chris Brown, who pleaded guilty to felony assault stemming from an incident with his then-girlfriend, Rihanna, before the Grammy Awards in 2009.
Geragos simultaneously worked on two highly publicized trials at the same time, and represented Michael Jackson in the 2004 molestation case while also leading the defense in Scott Peterson's trial. Jackson removed Geragos from his legal team due to the lawyer's workload.

"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harrys-nuclear-interview-would-have-horrified-queen-expert","Prince Harry’s nuclear interview would have ‘horrified’ queen: expert","Royal commentator and broadcaster Neil Sean weighs in on the new interview from Prince Harry.
Prince Harry declared on Friday that he wants to reconcile with his family after losing a court battle over his publicly funded security – but for the royal family, it’s too little, too late.
The claim was made by British royals expert Hilary Fordwich, who told Fox News Digital that everyone who knew the Duke of Sussex’s beloved grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, believed she would have been ""truly horrified"" by his latest tell-all.
""For her, it would indeed have been felt as a violation of both discretion and privacy,"" Fordwich explained. ""She valued the little privacy her family members could maintain in such an exposed role. Being betrayed by a family member, publicly airing grievances was abhorrent to her. She was particularly private regarding matters of health and family disputes.""

A similar sentiment was previously shared by unnamed sources with ITV News. The ""exasperated"" palace insiders told the outlet that the 40-year-old’s words about his father’s cancer were in ""poor taste"" and noted that his new outburst only shows there is ""nothing that can be trusted to remain private.""
During his sit-down with BBC News, Harry said, ""I don’t know how much longer my father has."" King Charles, 76, was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February 2024. The 40-year-old also told the network that the king wouldn’t speak to him due to the ""security stuff.""

Fordwich said the late queen would have been heartbroken over Harry’s repeated willingness to air his grievances. It was the late queen, Fordwich pointed out, who agreed to let Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, step back as senior members in 2020 and move to California.

England’s longest-reigning monarch died in 2022 at age 96.
""Queen Elizabeth at the time of ‘Megxit’ hoped for the best, for family unity and discretion,"" said Fordwich. ""She was focused on protecting the future of the monarchy. She guarded its reputation and continuity her entire life, focusing on stability.""

ITV reported that Harry’s comments about his father’s cancer ""went down very badly in royal circles."" Insiders noted that Harry’s decision to talk about his father’s health would have ""appalled"" the late queen.

""The king is a kind man with a warm heart and quite enough on his plate to deal with, without all this from his own son,"" a royal source told the outlet.
""The remarks about his illness were in particularly poor taste and, of course, suggest something entirely contrary to the reality.""
WATCH: PRINCE HARRY LOOKING TO RECONCILE WITH KING CHARLES, ROYAL FAMILY
Harry has been estranged from his family since he and his wife quit royal duties. They alleged hostility and racist attitudes by the press and the royal establishment. Since their exit, the couple has publicly spoken out in interviews and documentaries. Harry’s tell-all 2023 memoir ""Spare,"" stuffed with private details and embarrassing revelations, made things worse.

But Harry said what’s souring the relationship now is a decision to remove his police protection detail after he stopped being a working royal. On Friday, the Court of Appeal in London rejected Harry’s bid to restore the protection, saying a government committee was justified in deciding that security should be assessed on a case-by-case basis whenever Harry visits the U.K.

Harry blamed the palace, alleging that the decision to withdraw his security had been made at the direction of royal officials, who sit on the committee alongside police and government representatives. He said they were ""knowingly putting me and my family in harm’s way,"" hoping that the sense of threat ""would force us to come back.""
He suggested his father was part of the problem, saying he’d asked the king ""to step out of the way and let the experts do their job.""

British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard claimed that what should have been a 10-minute interview about Harry’s court case turned into a ""delusional, damning, self-absorbed moan.""
""The queen will especially be turning in her grave,"" Chard claimed to Fox News Digital. ""[Harry] has shown complete disrespect for the lifelong work of the late Queen Elizabeth II… The majority of people, even non-monarchists, held the highest admiration for the late Queen Elizabeth and the unifying role she played.""

According to Chard, the late queen had high hopes for Meghan, in particular, who was seen as a breath of fresh air for the monarchy. According to multiple reports, the queen was said to be hurt and saddened by the couple’s departure and how it was handled both personally and publicly.

""At first, the late queen was very impressed by Meghan and believed she would be an asset to the monarchy,"" Chard explained. ""She took her under her wing, offering help where needed. She even advised her that Sophie, now Duchess of Edinburgh, would help her with anything she may need.""
""Meghan didn’t utilize the favor,"" Chard claimed.
According to royal experts, Queen Elizabeth II had high hopes for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry following ""Megxit."" (Getty Images)
""She made it clear that all she needed was her husband… Meghan struggled to adjust to life in the royal fold… She was reluctant to take advice. She hoped to do things her way after her marriage, not the royal way. However, Meghan was quick to detail a lack of support by the royal family for her mental health issues and media intrusion. So, Harry and Meghan stepped down as working royals and moved abroad. But it was a very quick turnaround. Conditions were agreed as they were off.""

""If they had given more notice, not the knee-jerk race that Queen Elizabeth was forced to work with, I believe the queen, along with her family, may have worked out an alternative agreement for Harry and Meghan,"" Chard continued. ""Harry and Meghan wanted the best of both worlds. They were unhappy and unhealthily preoccupied with their problems.""
Harry and Meghan first detailed their struggles with royal life to Oprah Winfrey in 2021. Their explosive televised interview was viewed by nearly 50 million people globally. At the time, Harry’s grandfather, Prince Philip, battled poor health.

""He wasn’t against TV interviews, it was part of the modern royal job,"" Chard pointed out. ""But the family was taught to never forget that discretion and modesty were integral to being a member of the British royal family… The interview resulted in significant fallout, with serious allegations of racism and bullying… Prince Philip was disappointed with how they handled situations.""

""Prince William will never forgive Prince Harry for the hurt he caused their grandmother, let alone anything else,"" said Chard. ""Prince Harry has burnt his bridges. He’s not apologized and has blown all trust… the royal family will not reply to his comments, contradictions and deep-seated resentment.""
Fordwich agreed.
""Harry has inadvertently made further communication and reconciliation even more unlikely,"" she said. ""Perhaps he’s just oblivious to family norms or simply too self-centered to realize reality.""

Brad Arnold of 3 Doors Down told his fans on Wednesday that he was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and the band will have to cancel their tour while he battles the disease.
""I've got some not-so-good news for you today,"" the 46-year-old said in a video he posted to his Instagram.
The Mississippi native explained that he got checked out at a hospital after feeling sick a couple of weeks ago, and he was diagnosed with clear cell renal cell carcinoma ""that had metastasized into my lung.""
Arnold said he has ""no fear, I really sincerely am not scared of it at all.""

He noted that his diagnosis would, however, force the band to cancel their tour this summer.
""And we're sorry for that,"" he said. ""And I'd love for you to lift me up in prayer every chance you get.""
Referencing the band’s 2008 song ""It’s Not My Time,"" he said he planned to go listen to the relevant piece of music.
""Thank you, guys, so much. God loves you. We love you. See you,"" he concluded.

""Thank you for all the memories so far,"" Arnold added in the caption of his video. ""Now, I believe ‘ITS NOT MY TIME’ is really my song. This’ll be a battle so we need our prayers warriors! Thank y’all for being the best fans in the world. We love y’all!""
The band 3 Doors Down formed in the mid-1990s and, along with Arnold, includes Chet Roberts, Justin Biltonen, Chris Henderson and Greg Upchurch.

Arnold wrote one of the band’s biggest hits, 2000’s ""Kryptonite,"" when he was still in high school, according to TMZ.
He is the only founding member of the group still in the band.
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer, and it affects twice as many men as women, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

It can develop for no reason, but smoking, being overweight, high blood pressure and kidney disease can be contributing factors, per the outlet.

""Modern Family"" star Ariel Winter left Los Angeles to escape the trauma of growing up in the spotlight.
Winter, now 27, gained fame after starring in the ABC show as Alex Dunphy. As she transitioned from child star to teen celebrity, Winter said the negative comments about her body took a toll on her self-esteem.
""It was just everywhere,"" she told People magazine. ""It was every headline I read about myself, like, grown people writing articles about me saying how I looked terrible or pregnant or like a fat s---. I mean, I was 14. It totally damaged my self-esteem.""
""I understood what it was like to be hated,"" Winter added. ""No matter what I was going through, I was a target. It made it very difficult to look at myself in the mirror and go, ‘I love this version of me.'""

Winter's childhood wasn't only marred by the harsh lights of Hollywood. The young actress was allegedly abused by her mother, who has denied the allegations.
At the age of 14, Winter was placed with her sister, Shanelle Gray, after being removed from her home by Child Protective Services.
""I went on to have a great rest of my teenage years thanks to being under her custody,"" Winter told the outlet.

However, Winter is still pursuing acting along with producing. Some personal projects include starting a podcast and developing a cooking show, according to People magazine.
""I didn’t leave the industry,"" she told the outlet.
""I just left the city of L.A,"" Winter explained. ""It holds some not-great memories for me, and I’m young and never lived anywhere else, and thought, ‘Why not?’ If you’re no longer on a network show that shoots there, you don’t really have to be there, and if I get a network show, I can easily go back.""

Meghan Markle was worried about launching her lifestyle brand.
On the May 6 episode of her podcast, ""Confessions of a Female Founder,"" the Duchess of Sussex said she went through ""self-doubt"" in creating As Ever after being under the ""microscope"" of the public spotlight.
""I made a phone call, I said, ‘Is this gonna work? Like, is this actually gonna work?’ But I had self-doubt,"" the 43-year-old told Hanna Mendoza, founder of Clevr Blends.

""You can’t bring self-doubt to your team that’s junior to you,"" the mother of two admitted. ""They have to believe in what you’re creating and the vision and how you hold the line. But you still have to be able to have someone you can go to, to be human, and say, ‘I don’t know. Can you just tell me that this makes sense?’’
Markle told Mendoza that her team had uplifted her when she questioned herself.
""Thankfully, my partner said, ‘Are you joking? We’re so energized, this is amazing!’"" the ""Suits"" alum recalled. ""I got into that same headspace that any of us can, because some might look at it and say, at least for me, it will have so much exposure.""
The As Ever limited edition honey sold out in under five minutes. (As Ever)
""Whatever I put out in the world, [it] will have so much attention,"" she continued. ""And there’s a flip side to that coin, which we know. It’s a microscope that a lot of people don’t have to experience.""
Markle, a former American actress, became the Duchess of Sussex when she married Britain’s Prince Harry in 2018. They stepped back as senior members in 2020 and moved to California.
Following the couple’s royal exit, Markle, who originally had a lifestyle blog called ""The Tig,"" wanted to become an entrepreneur, allowing the couple to be financially independent. In the podcast, she described leaning on her close friends while building As Ever.

""The safety of stream of consciousness with someone who understands it… That is part of that sisterhood and that understanding of, ‘OK, every day is not going to be the same. Some days are going to be harder to show up as your best and shiniest self,’"" she said.
It also helped to partner with Netflix.
""Netflix coming on as my business partner is huge,"" said Markle. ""Just having a global powerhouse that believed in me, and the site selling out in the first 45 minutes of launch – everything, every single piece that we had been working on.""

""That told me that customers — people — believed in me and this vision,"" she shared. ""That's all you really want as a founder. That becomes your proof point that those late nights and the midnight musings are worth it.""
Markle faced several hiccups along her journey as an entrepreneur.
Last September, the mother of two suffered a professional setback when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office refused the application for American Riviera Orchard, the original name of the brand, The Telegraph reported.

As Ever was originally known as American Riviera Orchard. (As Ever)
According to the outlet, the office warned that businesses could not trademark geographical locations, noting that American Riviera was a ""common nickname"" for Santa Barbara, where Markle resides. The addition of the word ""Orchard"" made ""little difference.""
The outlet also warned that the descriptions of the duchess’ products could fit into multiple trademark categories.
At the time, Markle’s team said the pushback was ""routine and expected."" However, her issues did not end there.
The As Ever products, including the raspberry spread, sold out in under an hour. (Netflix)
Food and gift retailer Harry & David filed a protest against American Riviera Orchard in October, the New York Post reported. According to the outlet, they claimed that the name was too similar to their ""Royal Riviera"" product line.

In November, the outlet reported that the ""Suits"" alum’s legal team requested a three-month extension in an attempt to secure a trademark. The U.K.’s Independent reported that the duchess attempted to trademark the brand over the summer. However, it was rejected due to issues with how it was filed.
In February, Markle announced on Instagram that she was renaming her brand to As Ever.

Previously on her podcast, Markle said she secured the name As Ever in 2022. She said ""everything started to evolve"" in 2023, especially when she partnered with Netflix on both the brand and her lifestyle series, ""With Love, Meghan,"" which showcased some of her products.
""It was just so interesting because, you remember, I said, ‘I like ""American Riviera"" as an umbrella and then to be able to have verticals beneath it and maybe have the ""Orchard"" really small,’"" she said.
While the name ""American Riviera Orchard"" was first announced in March 2024, Markle said it quickly ""became this word salad.""

""I said, ‘OK, well, let's go back to the thing that I've always loved. Let's use the name that I had protected for a reason that had been sort of under wraps,’"" she said.
""We were able to focus in the quiet and put our heads down and build on something that no one was sniffing around to even see about. It was just really, really helpful to have that quiet period.""
As Markle geared up to launch As Ever, her brand faced other woes.

Francisca ""Xisca"" Mora, the mayor of the Mallorcan town of Porreres in Spain, claimed to local outlets that the Duchess of Sussex’s brand logo for As Ever was ""an exact copy"" of their historic coat of arms.
""I would like to clarify that the Porreres Town Hall, which I represent, has no intention of taking legal action against Ms. Meghan Markle,"" Mora told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""We consider it to be an unfortunate coincidence.""
""The only thing we ask for is respect for our historical and cultural heritage, such as the emblem of Porreres — an image that identifies us as a town and is part of our local culture,"" she added.

At the time, Fox News Digital reached out to a spokesperson for the duchess for comment.
Fox News Digital learned that the logo was a nod to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s home in California, where they are raising their two young children. Markle was also born in California. It is also understood that it was designed to create a personal emblem and that global searches for registered trademarks were conducted.
Following Markle’s announcement of As Ever, a New York City-based clothing line, also called As Ever, had to address the confusion over their names on social media.

""I want to say thank you to all the old friends who know and love our small family brand As Ever, and also say hi to all those that have just become aware we exist,"" founder Mark Kolski wrote on Instagram.
""In the last 36 hours, there has been an outpouring of support and concern regarding recent events around our namesake brand,"" the statement read. ""We are aware. We are not affiliated.""
""We are grateful for all the customers coast to coast and worldwide that have supported our venture. We will continue As Ever,"" the statement concluded.

In a video announcing the rebranding, Markle mentioned she had secured the name As Ever in 2022.
Fox News Digital understands that As Ever will not be designing clothing.
""Last year, I had thought, 'American Riviera, that sounds like such a great name.' It’s my neighborhood; it’s a nickname for Santa Barbara, but it limited me to things that were just manufactured and grown in this area,"" she explained in her Instagram video announcing the rebranding in February.

""Then Netflix came on, not just as my partner in the show, but as my partner in my business, which was huge. So, I thought about it, and I’ve been waiting for a moment to share a name that I had secured in 2022, and this is the moment, and it’s called As Ever.""
""As Ever essentially means as it’s always been, and if you’ve followed me since 2014 with The Tig, you know I’ve always loved cooking and crafting and gardening — this is what I do,"" she said. ""And I haven’t been able to share it with you in the same way for the past few years, but now I can, so as things are starting to trickle out there, I wanted you to hear it from me first.""

According to court documents viewed and obtained by Fox News Digital, the 44-year-old actor was arrested at Kings Supreme Criminal Court in Brooklyn on May 2.

According to the New York Post, which first broke the news of Pitt’s arrest, the multiple charges stem from four separate alleged incidents involving a former girlfriend between April 2020 and August 2021.

""In reality, this baseless claim is suspiciously raised some four or five years after the alleged incident, at a time when the two parties were in a completely consensual and voluntary relationship.

Kasey Musgraves knows that just because something has a simple sound doesn’t mean it’s easy to create.
""There may be a misconception that country music is easy to replicate,"" the country singer told The Hollywood Reporter in a recent interview. ""When you look at the bones of traditional country – the structure, the sounds, the subject matter – it’s not easy to replicate.""
Explaining that while the genre ""comes across as very simple, and the best country music is,"" it’s ""full of so many layers of heart and real life, real stories.""
""And there’s a lot of restraint,"" she added. ""Really good traditional country music, there’s a lot of space for the lyrics, the story, for the heartbreak and the texture. I really appreciate that about that era of country music. It paints a picture, but it’s subtle and it’s simple.""

And while some are celebrating Musgraves' ""return"" to the genre, the singer insists she ""never left.""
The 36-year-old is now back with her first label, Lost Highway Records, which once represented country legends like Willie Nelson and Lyle Lovett before it folded in 2012. The label recently relaunched, and Musgraves was the first to sign on.
""Really good traditional country music, there’s a lot of space for the lyrics, the story, for the heartbreak and the texture. I really appreciate that about that era of country music. It paints a picture, but it’s subtle and it’s simple.""
""While some might think of it as a ‘return,’ I want to make it super clear that I never left,"" the ""Deeper Well"" singer said. ""It’s always been a home base, and it’s truly where I’m sonically the most happy. But since the beginning, I’ve always had an exploratory foot out the door a little bit, allowing myself to infuse all these other genres that speak to me.""
John Janick, chairman and CEO of Interscope Capitol and IGA, said Musgraves is a perfect fit for Lost Highway Records.
""Lost Highway carved out a special place in the remarkable musical legacy of Nashville,"" he shared in a statement to Holler, a country music magazine.. ""It was a left-of-center label with one-of-a-kind artists who, at their core, were great songwriters and moved culture. With this new chapter in Lost Highway's history, we are devoted to empowering the next generation of trailblazers, both artists and executives"".
He added, ""Kacey exemplifies the kind of culture-shifting, left-of-center artists that Lost Highway has always been known for. Given the close relationship she's had with both Lost Highway and Interscope, it seemed only natural for her to be the first artist signed in this new chapter.""
Musgraves also covered Hank Williams’ 1949 song ""Lost Highway"" to mark rejoining the eponymous label.

The singer said, ""It really feels good to wholeheartedly embrace that sound, because I’m always listening to that kind of thing.""

""I wanted to bring it back to life,"" she explained of the song, which was originally recorded in 1949. ""When I was in the studio, I looked into the genesis of the song, and I was taken aback to find it has real ties to where I’m from.

I almost fell out of my chair – Alba is the next town over to the teeny, tiny town I’m from, Golden. Alba has no more than 500 people; I’ve never heard it referenced anywhere in pop culture. This song is full-circle for me, in terms of where I started and where I am now, my label.""
Six years ago, Musgraves confirmed that getting her music on the radio isn't necessarily her barometer of a successful song.

""That's not what I had in mind when I was making this album,"" she continued about ""Golden Hour,"" which won the album of the year award at the time. ""It's been really amazing and incredible to see it do some really wild, gratifying, unbelievable things – going further than I ever thought that it could. I'm just really thankful. I think streaming was a big part of it... My publicist for working his a-- off. My band and my road family working very hard.
""And ultimately, I feel like it just lets me know that it doesn't really matter where someone hears your music, it's if they connect or not,"" Musgraves concluded.

He notes writing his memoir, ""Karen: A Brother Remembers,"" in honor of his sister helped fortify his faith.
Kelsey Grammer has seen his share of tragedy in his life, but it was one moment of unspeakable loss that nearly broke his faith in God.
The Emmy-winning ""Frasier"" star opened up about the spiritual toll he endured after the brutal murder of his sister Karen in 1975.
Grammer penned a memoir, ""Karen: A Brother Remembers"" to honor the life of his sister and told Fox News Digital how his latest project restored his faith in God.

""When the deaths occurred, starting with my grandfather, and then my dad — and I didn't really know my dad — and then when Karen was killed, hanging on to what I'd always seen as a kind of gift of faith, became ... hollow faith,"" Grammer explained.
""It wasn't working. I thought, ‘Why did I lose this? What happened?’ I felt betrayed by it. And, so, I sort of cursed God at one point and said, ‘You know, hey, I’d rather you didn't bother to help at this point because, honestly, this was colossal. I'm not interested.'""
In Grammer’s memoir, ""Karen,"" he recounted the deeply personal and tragic story of his late sister, who was murdered at the age of 18. He was just 20 years old and studying theater at Juilliard in New York when his younger sister, a recent high school graduate, moved to Colorado Springs.
""I felt betrayed by it. And, so, I sort of cursed God at one point and said, ‘You know, hey, I’d rather you didn't bother to help at this point because, honestly, this was colossal. I'm not interested.""
She was kidnapped by several men who had intended to rob a Red Lobster where she worked. They instead kidnapped Karen, raped her repeatedly and ultimately stabbed her to death.

In 1976, Freddie Glenn was convicted of killing Karen Grammer and two other victims from the previous year. The Supreme Court ruled Glenn could seek parole after 30 years, but the sitcom star has twice helped block Glenn's attempts at parole as justice for his sister and the other victims' families.
""He just thinks it's been long enough and, so, when do I get out of prison? So, when am I done with mine then? Because I'm still stuck,"" Grammer told Fox News Digital. ""And although this book has helped release a great deal of that feeling, there is a kind of … well, ‘We're in this together, Freddie, you and me.’ And … if I don't get free, you’re not either.""
WATCH: KELSEY GRAMMER ‘CURSED GOD' AFTER SISTER KAREN'S MURDER
At a parole hearing in 2009, Grammer wrote a letter to the court that said, ""She was my best friend and the best person I knew. She had so much to live for. I loved my sister, Karen. I miss her. I miss her in my bones.
""I was her big brother. I was supposed to protect her — I could not. I have never gotten over it. ... It very nearly destroyed me.""
Before his sister’s death, the 70-year-old star first experienced loss at the age of 13 when his father was shot and killed during a home invasion. After the death of Karen, Grammer’s two half-brothers, Stephen and Billy, died in a scuba diving accident in the Virgin Islands.
Grammer's faith began to slowly mend through love and family. (Harper Select)
Grammer admitted he turned away from God in his darkest moments, but he encouraged others to do the opposite.
""I would advise people to step away from that. If I could, I would say, rather than turn away from God, turn toward Him in these situations,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Because it isn't like God’s out to get you. But it feels like that sometimes. And that was very hard.""
Although that sense of brokenness followed Grammer for years, his faith slowly began to mend through love and family.

The couple share three children and named their first daughter Faith.
Grammer has continued to find peace through reflection, especially when he wrote his memoir, ""Karen: A Brother Remembers.""
The ""Cheers"" star told Fox News Digital what inspired him to write this memoir 50 years after his sister's death.

""I was instructed through a medium that Karen wanted me to tell her story. … I had a session with her in which she brought me Karen's wishes,"" Grammer said.
'FRASIER' STAR KELSEY GRAMMER FORGIVES HIS SISTER'S KILLER BUT WON'T 'ADVOCATE FOR HIS FREEDOM'
""I'm very, very happy with the book. I'm happy that I did it. I feel lighter that I actually was able to accomplish it because I carried around a lot of woe, a lot of grief.""
In his memoir, Grammer recounted the memories of his sister and how her loss affected him and his family. As Grammer courageously confronted the pain of losing a loved one to senseless violence, he celebrated his late sister’s life in the most profound way.
When Fox News Digital asked Grammer one memory that stood out to him and brought him comfort when he thought about Karen, he shared an emotional moment when he bonded with his beloved sister at a young age.

WATCH: KELSEY GRAMMER DOESN'T THINK CLOSURE IS POSSIBLE AFTER SUFFERING A TRAGIC LOSS
""That's one thing I say … she was an Oreo cookie dipped in ice-cold Coca-Cola. I think of that moment. … There was a moment when we were sitting there. … We were both sitting on a green couch in our living room in Florida, and then she thought she would dip an Oreo cookie in Coca-Cola. … It was fantastic.""
In the end, Grammer didn’t speak of closure as a destination but as a quiet shift in the way grief and love coexist.

""I don't think closure is possible when you've suffered a tragic loss in your life. The look for me of closure would be that, somewhere between the grief that is constant and is sometimes as alive as the moment it first took place, will be balanced in time by a fondness for the person that you loved and a memory that will at least stand face to face on the same level as the grief does.""

Kelly's attorney, Nicole Blank Becker, said Sean ""Diddy"" Combs may drop big names in a desperate attempt to regain his freedom.
Sean ""Diddy"" Combs faces 15 years to life in prison if found guilty of sex crimes charges during an estimated eight-week trial, which kicked off Monday, May 5.
The female-driven team for the U.S. Attorney's Office includes eight lawyers, according to the docket. The five women designated as leads include Emily Anne Johnson, Madison Reddick Smyser, Mary Christine Slavik, Meredith Foster and Mitzi Steiner.
Maurene Ryan Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, is also listed for the prosecution, in addition to Matthew Raffi Shahabian and Olga Zverovich. Maurene's father was fired by President Donald Trump during his first term in the White House after the handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe.

No stranger to high-profile trials, Maurene previously served as a lead prosecutor in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell.
Maxwell was found guilty on five counts after a monthlong trial and sentenced in 2022 to 20 years in prison for her role in a scheme to sexually exploit and abuse minor girls with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

He talked about the impact they have had on the industry and his future plans to retire.
Smokey Robinson was accused of sexual misconduct and false imprisonment Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by four anonymous former employees, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.
Smokey, 85, is accused of harassing and assaulting four former housekeepers who worked at his Chatsworth home between 2006 and 2024, according to the suit. The accusers are seeking $50 million in damages.
Frances Robinson, Smokey's wife of 25 years, was also accused of perpetuating a ""hostile work environment.""
The accusers claimed Frances ""failed to take the appropriate corrective action to prevent Defendant Smokey Robinson’s deviant misconduct"" despite having ""full knowledge of his prior acts of sexual misconduct, having settled cases with other women that suffered and experienced similar sexual assaults perpetuated by him.""

Representatives for Smokey did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
Jane Doe 1 (JD1) worked for the Motown legend from January 2023 through February 2024, but was forced to resign due to Smokey's ""repeated sexual assaults and sexual harassment against her,"" the suit states.
She claimed Smokey sexually assaulted her ""at least 7 times"" while she was employed by the family. She was unwilling to report the incidents due to ""her fear of losing her livelihood, familial reprisal, public embarrassment, shame and humiliation to her and her family, the possible adverse effect on her immigration status, as well as being threatened and intimidated by Defendant Smokey Robinson’s well-recognized celebrity status and his influential friends and associates,"" documents say.
Smokey would allegedly call JD1 into his ""blue bedroom,"" lock the door and, while wearing only his underwear, ""neatly place a white towel on his bed, not to soil the bed linens, in preparation for what was about to occur.""

""In a desperate attempt to get him to stop his sexual assaults, she would proclaim ‘you’re married,' to which he would casually ignore,"" JD1 claimed. Additionally, the accuser claimed Smokey and his wife ""failed to pay minimum wage or pay overtime wages"" and did not provide rest or lunch breaks.
Jane Doe 2 (JD2) claimed sexual assaults began in 2016 when the ""Tracks of My Tears"" singer would send text messages for JD2 to meet him in areas of the Chatsworth home where closed-circuit cameras weren't located. Upon arrival, she claimed he would ""proceed to rape her.""
JD2 also claimed Smokey assaulted her at least 23 times and would ""threaten her that if she refused to have sex with him, he would make Defendant Frances Robinson be ‘mean’ to her,"" the lawsuit states.

She claimed Smokey ""repeatedly raped"" her at least 20 times, and, on one occasion, when she resisted his advances, Smokey allegedly offered JD3 ""$500 to allow him to orally copulate her, an offer she refused,"" according to documents.
Jane Doe 4 (JD4) worked as a housekeeper and served as Frances' personal assistant, cook and hairdresser, beginning in October 2006. She claimed Smokey first sexually assaulted her the following year at his Las Vegas home.

Ellen DeGeneres appeared to bite off a little more than she could chew when she took on a common household chore.
A recent Instagram video posted by the former talk show host shows DeGeneres attempting to mow the lawn at her new home in the U.K. in a video shot by her wife, ""Arrested Development"" actress Portia de Rossi.
""Portia thought it would be fun to film my first time on the mower,"" DeGeneres wrote in the caption. ""She was right.""
The video starts off with DeGeneres on a ride-on mower successfully mowing a small flat portion of her lawn, with the words ""How it started"" written on the screen.

The Hollywood couple first made headlines when they reportedly moved to the U.K. in November 2024 after Donald Trump was elected president. They sold one of their homes in Montecito, California, in August 2024 and sold their second home in the city in March.
""Portia thought it would be fun to film my first time on the mower. … She was right.""
""Ellen was in England house hunting in the beginning of October,"" a source told People when the couple first moved. ""She ended up finding a house that she loved and purchased it shortly after.""

Shortly after news of the couple's big move broke, the two were spotted out with a group of friends at The Farmer's Dog in the Cotswolds, a countryside region in England. It is unclear where in the U.K. they relocated to, but they are rumored to live in the English countryside.
DeGeneres is not the only comedian who left after President Trump won the election. In a TikTok video shared in March 2025, Rosie O'Donnell shared she left the country and moved to Ireland Jan. 15, five days before Trump's inauguration.
In the video, O'Donnell explained she ""was someone who never thought I would move to another country,"" but she thought it was best for her and her young child.
""I miss my other kids,"" she added of her five grown children. ""I miss my friends. I miss many things about life there at home. And I’m trying to find a home here in this beautiful country. And when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back.""

""I’ve been a political person my whole life. Not better or worse. It's just a different way to be in the world.
""I was very clear about the reason why I was leaving, and I don’t think it came as a surprise to anyone. We’re not really in each other’s worlds, and it’s been kind of awkward, but you know what? I wish her the best. I wish that she has peace and love in her life and that she is OK.""

Kelsea Ballerini doesn't believe in glamorizing divorce.
Ballerini, who released ""Rolling Up The Welcome Mat"" to chronicle her divorce from country singer Morgan Evans, clarified that she isn't the ""poster child for divorce."" After releasing the album, the 31-year-old musician found that fans connected with her story.
""I remember being like, 'Oh, man, I’m terrified,'"" Ballerini told Elle magazine of the night before the album's release in 2023. ""I went to sleep, and the next morning, I was like, ‘Oh, it’s OK. People are finding this and connecting with this.’ But it was definitely a scary feeling.""
Now, the CMA award-winner has fans showing up to her concerts with signs that read ""Just got a divorce.""

""I try to never celebrate it until I know if it’s a good thing. I don’t ever want to be a poster child for divorce,"" she told the outlet. ""It’s been three years now. It’s simply not in the forefront of my life anymore.""
""But I always make sure when these women come up to me, my first reaction is never, ‘Oh my God, congratulations!’ It’s like, ‘Are you OK?’ Because just like it needs to be destigmatized, I also don’t think it should be celebrated or glamorized,"" Ballerini said.
Ballerini and Evans wed in 2017. After nearly five years of marriage, the two announced their divorce in 2022 on Instagram. Ballerini and Evans originally met in 2016 while hosting the CMC Music Awards in Australia.
""Because just like it needs to be destigmatized, I also don’t think it should be celebrated or glamorized.""

""I’ve always tried to share my life with you in a real and vulnerable way, while also protecting layers of my personal life as they unfold,"" Ballerini wrote at the time. ""This is now public record so I wanted you to hear from me directly that I am going through a divorce.""
Evans wrote in his own statement, ""I am very sad to confirm that after almost 5 years of marriage, Kelsea and I are parting ways. I wish it were otherwise but sadly it is not.""

The two seem to be going strong as they recently moved in together, according to People magazine. Stokes revealed they never go longer than three weeks without seeing each other.
""If we need to make the effort to show up when one's across the country, we do it,"" he told the outlet. ""The amount of effort that we put into our careers, we should be doubling that in our personal lives. It's not always easy, and it's not always convenient, but having a big, beautiful life didn't come from convenience or ease.""

Ballerini has released new music since putting her heartbreak out for the world to hear. However, she still finds it easy to write about the ""growing pains"" of life.
""I’ve always gravitated toward writing about the unsteadiness in life, whether that’s a version of heartbreak or just growing pains. I love writing about growing up and the uncomfortable nature of that. The hardest part for me is to write when I’m happy,"" she told Elle magazine.
""It’s so much easier, because songwriting is so therapeutic for me, to sit down when I’m down in the dumps about something rather than when I’m happy. Because when you’re happy, you want to go exist in your happiness, not sit down with your guitar. But I will say making ‘Patterns’ was truly reflective of the year and a half that I wrote it. So there is turmoil and growing pains in that, and there is happiness, but it’s not sugarcoated.
Kelsea Ballerini said she doesn't want to be the ""poster child for divorce."" (Adrienne Raquel/Elle Magazine)
""Even ‘First Rodeo,’ which I think is the first love song that I wrote for ‘Patterns,’ is literally saying, ‘I fell off the horse. That was embarrassing. I felt like damaged goods. Oh my God, here you are. Can we take this slow because this is not where I saw my life going, but now I want to try this again?’ It’s an unconventional love song, and that’s what interests me, the nuance of it, not just ‘Friday night in your truck, let’s go to the bar.’""

Basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal is weighing in on the recent Blue Origin space flight.
Blue Origin was founded by Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos.
O'Neal mentioned the recent high-profile Blue Origin flight, which featured an all-female crew, during a recent discussion with comedian David Spade.

O'Neal, a four-time NBA champion, suggested the trip to space did not actually occur. O'Neal's theory seemed to center around his belief that Bezos was never willing to send his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, into space.

But O'Neal also pointed out what he believed were discrepancies within a video Blue Origin released. From the 51-year-old NBA analyst's perspective, something in the recording appeared to be off.
""I know Jeff loves Laura. He wouldn't want anything to happen to her,"" O'Neal told Spade during a recent edition of the ""The Big Podcast with Shaq.""

""So, I think there was some green screen involvement there. That’s one. No. 2, their hair was luxurious in space. Katy Perry’s hair didn’t move. Laura’s hair didn’t move. Nobody’s hair moved. Then I saw when they landed Jeff had the special key, but it was already open. So, I’m going to go Universal Studios green screen on this one.""
Fox News Digital contacted Blue Origin for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

Several celebrities attended the event last month, including Oprah, a close friend of King's. The mission spanned 10 minutes and 21 seconds.
Perry said the experience of going to space was ""second to being a mom.""
""That’s why it was hard for me to go because that’s all my love right there. And I have to surrender and trust that the universe is going to take care of me, protect me and also my family and my daughter,"" she said.

Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark's popularity ahead of the 2025 WNBA season is unquestioned, and the league’s commissioner put any debate to rest Thursday.
Clark and the Fever will play in 41 nationally televised games this season, more than the defending champion New York Liberty.
The Fever also announced a direct-to-consumer service in partnership with Endeavor Streaming after Clark’s memorable rookie season and unprecedented viewership of WNBA games in 2024.

Clark may be just one player in a league of terrific basketball players, but the numbers don’t lie.
""It is a balance, but she's a generational talent,"" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said on ""The Bill Simmons Podcast."" ""No league is ever about one player, but in this case, Caitlin brought tens of millions of new viewers into the W.
""And there's no denying that impact. Not just in the WNBA, but the world of sports. (NBA Commissioner) Adam (Silver) and I talk all the time about this. She's the most popular athlete in America.""
Engelbert stressed the balance there has to be because of a potential risk of injury, pointing to JuJu Watkins’ knee injury in the women's NCAA Tournament.

A women's college basketball coach was arrested last week for alleged drunken driving after police said he was found parked in his front yard and smelled like alcohol.
Kevin McGuff, the head coach at Ohio State, took more than two minutes to open the driver's side door or window before refusing a Breathalyzer and denying he had been drinking or taken medications that could result in impairment, according to a police report obtained by The Columbus Dispatch.
McGuff was asked to recite the alphabet from letters D through R, an order he was given three times, but he said nothing after D, according to police.

Scottie Scheffler, the world's top-ranked golfer, appeared to turn some heads at the PGA Championship Thursday.
The normally even-keeled and quiet golfer took exception to the PGA of America's decision not to play lift, clean, place for the first round of the PGA Championship at the soggy Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte.
The PGA of America is the governing body of the tournament, which is the second major of the season.

On Wednesday, the organization released a statement saying it would ""play the ball down, as it lies."" The announcement came after the course was doused with several inches of rain before the first round.
Several players were effectively forced to contend with what is often referred to as ""mud balls,"" making the trajectory of hit balls less manageable.
PGA CHAMPIONSHIP WINNERS: LIST OF CHAMPIONS BY YEAR
Scheffler hit a tee shot to the middle of the fairway on hole No. 16, and the shot hooked to the left and went into the water for a double bogey.

""This is going to be the last answer that I give on playing it up or down,’’ Scheffler said. ""I mean, I don’t make the rules. I think when you’re looking at the purest forms of golf, like if you’re going to go play links golf, there’s absolutely no reason on a links golf course you should play the ball up. It doesn’t matter how much rain they get. The course could be flooded underwater, and the ball is still going bounce somehow because of the way the turf is and the ground underneath the turf.
""In American golf, it’s significantly different. When you have overseeded fairways that are not sand-capped, there’s going to be a lot of mud on the ball, and that’s just part of it. When you think about the purest test of golf, I don’t personally think that hitting the ball in the middle of the fairway you should get punished for.""

Scheffler acknowledged the position ""a golf purist"" would likely take, but the two-time Masters winner suggested the rule decision created unforeseen conditions for competitors.
""On a golf course as good of condition as this one is, this is probably a situation in which it would be the least likely difference in playing it up because most of the lies you get out here are all really good.
""I understand how a golf purist would be, ‘Oh, play it as it lies.’ But I don’t think they understand what it’s like literally working your entire life to learn how to hit a golf ball and control it and hit shots and control distance, and all of a sudden, due to a rules decision, that is completely taken away from us by chance.
""In golf, there’s enough luck throughout a 72-hole tournament that I don’t think the story should be whether or not the ball is played up or down. When I look at golf tournaments, I want the purest, fairest test of golf, and, in my opinion, maybe the ball today should have been played up.

Scheffler rallied from the tough break on the 16th hole and finished Thursday 2-under par. Ryan Gerard was at the top of the leaderboard Thursday evening. The PGA Championship continues Friday.

The leaderboard at the 2025 PGA Championship is a head-scratcher for some, but Quail Hollow Club’s challenge could be summed up perfectly by one hole the top three golfers in the world all struggled with during Thursday’s opening round.
Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlory and Xander Schauffele are ranked one through three in the Official World Golf Ranking, respectively, and they all finished with a double bogey on the par-4, 535-yard 16th hole in their opening rounds.
Their trouble with the hole was on full display as a featured group for the start of the tournament, and McIlroy fired his tee shot to the left, which is an area to avoid due to water. The rough caught his ball, but an awkward lie didn’t allow him to get the ball more than 20 yards into the fairway.

From there, McIlroy’s approach missed the green to the right, and the back left pin didn’t make it easy to stick it close to walk away with a bogey. He had a 12-foot putt to walk away with a five, but he missed and made double instead.
Scheffler and Schauffele had better luck off the tee, but they both struggled to find the green in regulation. With water around it, they both found the bottom with their approach shots that went too far.

Both players dropped in the penalty area to continue the hole, and, again, the location was treacherous for all golfers and made it difficult to get it close. Scheffler had 52 feet to card a bogey, but he hit in a seven-footer to make a double. Then, Schauffele two-putted from about 34 feet.
Scheffler fared better than McIlroy and Schauffele, finishing his opening round tied for 19th at 2-under. Schauffele walked into the clubhouse at 1-over after 18 holes, while McIlroy, winner of the Masters in April, was 3-over after shooting a 74.

After his round, Scheffler told reporters the dreaded ""mud ball"" was the cause of his 16th hole mishap.
""It’s one of those deals where it’s frustrating to hit the ball in the middle of the fairway and get mud on it and have no idea where it’s going to go,"" he told reporters. ""I understand it’s part of the game, but there’s nothing more frustrating for a player.
""You spend your whole life trying to learn how to control a golf ball, and due to a rules decision, all of a sudden you have absolutely no control over where that golf ball goes. But I don’t make the rules. I just have to deal with the consequences of those rules.""
The three weren’t the only top golfers struggling to figure out Quail Hollow Thursday. Bryson DeChambeau (1-over), Max Homa (2-over), Jordan Spieth (3-over) and Brooks Koepka (4-over) were all struggling to find a groove. Phil Mickelson even carded an 8-over 79, which will be virtually impossible to get down before the cut Friday.

Not everyone had the same experience. American Ryan Gerard was leading for most of the day after shooting a 5-under 66. Australian Cam Davis matched him, walking into the clubhouse with the same score, though he could've led at 6-under if not for a bogey on the final hole.

Several current NFL stars have expressed interest in competing in flag football in just over three years when the Summer Olympics return to the U.S.
On Thursday, the league announced team owners will consider a resolution concerning whether active players can participate in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
Last month, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said interest in competing in the Summer Olympics has been a hot topic in the league, adding a resolution on the issue may be forthcoming.

New England Patriots defensive tackle Christian Barmore was hit with a huge blow last year when he was diagnosed with blood clots.
His 2024 season was cut short, but the 2021 second-round pick received great news on Thursday.
Barmore was cleared for football activity, paving the way for a return to the gridiron later this year.

Barmore will be a full participant in voluntary organized team activities (OTAs) next week.
""Yeah. That's the goal. I just have to keep following the medical team, but everything is looking really well,"" Barmore said.
Barmore was initially diagnosed with the clots in July, but he was able to get back on the field in November. However, he only managed to play in just four games before hitting the non-football illness list.
""It was one of the hardest times. I felt like I did everything in my power, wanting to come back,"" Barmore said, via ESPN. ""I don't want to ever be in that situation again, or anybody in the world to go through that. That stuff was no joke. It was a hard challenge.""

He had a breakout third season with the Patriots in 2023, collecting a career-high 8.5 sacks and 64 combined tackles over 17 games.
It’s what led the Patriots to sign him to a four-year extension worth a maximum $92 million, including $41.8 million guaranteed at signing before he began the final year on his rookie deal.

Craig Carton, Danny Parkins and Mark Schlereth discuss the matchup and what it means for the NFL.
The NFL released the 2025 schedule for all 32 teams on Wednesday night, and some teams have a lighter schedule than others.
The league does not have a balanced schedule, which is why some squads will see tougher or easier schedules regardless of how they did last season.
Trying to predict the strength of a schedule is an inexact science because teams do change a lot from season to season, whether that would be in free agency, the NFL Draft or changes to the front office and coaching staff.

However, the Washington Commanders entered last season with the second-easiest strength of schedule and had a strong 12-5 season, with an NFC Championship game appearance.
Here are the three teams whose 2025 opponents have the lowest combined win percentage from the 2024 season.
The 49ers had a down year last season, going 6-11 after previously representing the NFC in Super Bowl LVIII. The team’s schedule this year might be the first step in returning to the playoffs.
San Francisco's 2025 opponents had a combined win percentage of .415 in 2024.
The 49ers only play four games against teams that made the playoffs last season, with two of those games coming against their division rival, the Los Angeles Rams.
The following is the 49ers' schedule:
The Saints have the second-easiest schedule, with their opponents' combined win percentage from last season at .419.
New Orleans is coming off a 5-12 season, and with the recent surprise retirement of quarterback Derek Carr, the team might need an easier schedule to sneak into the playoffs this year.

Ronald Sipayung, police chief at Soekarno-Hatta Airport, said authorities raided Shaw's apartment just outside the country's capital of Jakarta, where they seized 132 pieces of cannabis candy.

A tip came from airport customs saying Shaw received a ""suspicious airway package from Thailand."" While cannabis has been decriminalized in Thailand, it remains illegal in Indonesia
Shaw told police he wanted to share the candy with his teammates, Sipayung said.

""We are still running the investigation to uncover the international drugs network behind this case and to stop its distribution,"" Sipayung added.
Shaw was present during a news conference Wednesday on the matter wearing an orange T-shirt and mask with his hands tied.
He has played for several Indonesian Basketball League teams, including the Tangerang Hawks, the team he signed a contract with last year. Shaw has been playing in the league since 2022.

However, Hawks manager Tikky Suwantikno told reporters Thursday Shaw was immediately let go due to breach of contract. The league has also banned him from playing.
""We don't tolerate players, administrators or anyone in the field involved in drugs,"" Indonesian Basketball League Chair Budisatrio Djiwandono said. ""There is no room for drug users in the basketball world.""
There are about 530 people on death row in Indonesia, and most of them are in prison for drug-related crimes, according to Ministry of Immigration and Corrections' data. Of that total, 96 were foreigners.
The last time executions took place was July 2016, when an Indonesian and three foreigners were executed.

Shaw, a Dallas native, played college basketball for Oklahoma State and Utah State. The 6-foot-10 forward saw more playing time with Utah State, averaging 28.3 minutes per game in 58 contests.
During his time with the Aggies, Shaw averaged 14.2 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.1 blocks.

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/california-facing-growing-controversy-trans-athlete-advances-state-track-field-postseason","Trump admin sends warning to California as trans athlete advances in state track and field championship","California girls' high school athletes reflect on their experience competing against a trans athlete in a postseason meet, as the state continues to defend its policies on gender eligibility.
EXCLUSIVE: President Donald Trump's administration is putting California and Governor Gavin Newsom on notice ahead of a controversial track and field postseason meet that will feature a biologically male trans athlete competing in the girls' category.
The U.S. Department of Education called out Newsom, the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) and Jurupa Valley High School over the upcoming meet and previous reporting that CIF officials made competitors at last Saturday's postseason event remove their ""Protect Girls Sports"" shirts throughout the day.
""CIF’s and Jurupa Valley High School’s apparent flouting of federal civil rights law by allowing a male athlete to compete in a female California track and field [Southern Sectional Division 3 Final] this Saturday, and the alleged retaliation against the girls who are protesting this, is indefensible,"" Julie Hartman, a Department of Education spokeswoman, told Fox News Digital.
The CIF is already under a federal Title IX investigation over the state's trans inclusion practices.
""California Governor Gavin Newsom, who in a startling moment of moral clarity, recently remarked that it was ‘deeply unfair’ for men to compete in women’s sports,"" Hartman continued. ""Where is Governor Newsom now? With or without the Governor, the Trump Administration’s Department of Education’s commitment is unwavering: we will not allow institutions to trample upon women’s civil rights. OCR’s investigation into CIF continues with vigor.""

California's high school sports league was one of the first in the nation to openly announce its defiance of President Donald Trump's ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order. Now, the state is facing growing unrest from its own residents over the issue in addition to the federal investigation.
A trans track and field athlete for Jurupa Valley High School will be competing in the high jump, triple jump and long jump after advancing in the prelims last Saturday. The athlete took a top-9 spot in those events, keeping three female athletes from advancing, while taking first in the triple jump.
Brea Olinda student Julia Teven, 17, is one of the athletes set to face the trans competitor on Saturday. Teven is also one of the few female athletes to have beaten Jurupa Valley's athlete this year, tying for first place in the high jump at the prelims last Saturday, while the trans athlete finished eighth.
However, Teven also claimed she has seen the trans athlete jump much higher in social media posts, and acknowledges that the athlete could still beat her this upcoming Saturday, noting the scoring system of the final is different than the prelims.
""He could beat me, for this one he didn't, but looking forward he could,"" Teven said,
Still, Teven doesn't blame the athlete for the issue, she blames the institution allowing it.
""I genuinely believe he doesn't have a harmful intent towards girls sports. I think it's the kind of like, CIF allowing him that's kind of put him in his position,"" Teven said. ""I think genuinely, he's just, like, being enabled by the CIF, and he's just taking his opportunity presented to him.""
Crean Lutheran student Reese Hogan, 16, also finished ahead of the trans athlete in high jump, at fifth place. But it was a different story during triple jump.
The trans athlete dominated the event, winning by more than four feet over the runner-up.
Hogan finished third, and would have placed one spot higher were it not for the trans athlete.
""It's just kind of sad just watching. He's obviously a really talented athlete, we've all seen him jump and stuff, and I wish him the best of luck, but in a boys' division,"" Hogan said. ""It's pretty obvious the certain advantages that he has, and it's obviously just sad as a woman to watch that.""
TEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO A CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND

The competitors had to wait through an hours-long delay on Saturday to finish the competition after temperatures exceeded over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, putting the meet in a heat danger delay.
The heated nature of the event extended into the temper's of the spectators.
The meet was overshadowed by controversy and protest, as activists held a live press conference that saw students, parents and even public education officials bash the CIF and state government for allowing what was happening that day.
The CIF has acknowledged that its officials made athletes at the meet take off the ""Protect Girls Sports"" shirts that they wore in protest, claiming it was due to standard apparel policy.
""Per the CIF Southern Section Playoff Bulletin, all athletes must be dressed in proper, school issued, track uniforms. The student-athletes were asked to comply with this while in the on-field event area, as they were wearing said shirts over their school-issued uniform,"" the CIF said in a statement.
However, witnesses allege that the officials did not give the same orders to athletes wearing non-school-issued gear that didn't include the ""Protect Girls Sports"" message.
Footage on social media shows some spectators chanting ""that's a boy!"" at the athlete. But Hogan and fellow Crean Lutheran student Olivia Viola told Fox News digital that other fans only cheered for the trans athlete during the event while remaining silent for the female competitors.
""I know it was like, really, really split, specifically, like when he was jumping, and it was like you could visibly see it, almost like it felt like half the stadium was, like, against it. And then there was like a little chunk of people over here that would, like, cheer really loudly for everything he did,"" Viola said.
""It just was bothersome to me. It was a little bit sad to hear people cheering louder for the biological male competing in a female sport than the females competing in the female sports. That part was just a little bit, that part was saddening to me.""
Viola, who will also compete against the trans athlete on Saturday, added that she also puts the blame on the CIF for hostile, conflicting crowds at the meet.
""I think it's 100% on the people in authority who are allowing it to happen and not him, not this athlete. I don't want the protests to be turned against this athlete, I want it to be turned and I do think most of us want it to be turned against the people in authority and the adults who need to stand up for us and CIF,"" Viola said.
Some public institutions in California already are standing up, including Hogan and Viola's school.
Three California Christian schools have spoken out against the CIF over the situation. JSerra Catholic High School, Orange Lutheran High School and Crean Lutheran High School sent a joint letter to the CIF last week, calling out the issue that has erupted for religious schools this track and field season.
""CIF’s Gender Identity Policy also fosters an environment that is increasingly hostile to religious member schools. CIF’s expectation that all faith-based schools facilitate the CIF Gender Identity Policy puts religious schools in the untenable position of adhering to the tenets of their faith in their classrooms and communities but practicing something contrary to their faith on their athletic fields,"" the letter read.
California Family Council outreach director told Fox News Digital that parents plan to protest at the southern sectional final.
""As a former CIF and college athlete in California, I am beyond grateful and encouraged to finally see an administration that is boldly standing up for girls. The Trump administration’s willingness to call out the injustice happening at CIF and Jurupa High School is exactly what female athletes across this state have been waiting for,"" Lorey said.
CALIFORNIA GIRL OPENS UP ON FIGHTING LEGAL AND POLITICAL BATTLE OVER TRANS ATHLETES AFTER LIFE-CHANGING PAIN
The Jurupa Unified School District provided a statement to Fox News Digital responding to the Department of Education's statement, defending its continued enabling of biological males in girls' sports.
""JUSD continues to follow both California law and CIF policy regarding school athletics. Both state law and CIF policy currently require that students be permitted to participate in athletic teams and competitions consistent with their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil's records. JUSD remains committed to protecting the rights and safety of the students we serve, in accordance with applicable state and federal laws,"" the statement read.
California has been a minefield of controversial incidents involving trans athlete inclusion in girls' and women's sports for over a year, which has included multiple incidents involving volleyball teams, girls' basketball teams and girls' cross country.
Some of the incidents have even prompted forfeits and even lawsuits.
Newsom addressed the issue during an episode of his podcast in early March.
""Well, I think it's an issue of fairness,"" Newsom said to conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. ""I completely agree with you on that. It's deeply unfair.
""So that's easy to call out the unfairness of that. There's also a humility and a grace… these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.

""So both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think you know is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue?
""The question you're asking is the question we've been asking ourselves for months and haven't been able to answer. What is that line? How can you make this fair? I haven't been able to figure it out, and I'm about as transparent about this as anybody out there, especially in my party on this. To the extent someone can and do it in a way that's respectful and responsible and could find the kind of balance, then I'm open to that discussion.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/deion-sanders-backs-mel-kiper-analysts-viral-nfl-draft-meltdown-shedeur","Deion Sanders defends ESPN analyst who was mocked for outrage over Shedeur Sanders' draft slide","NFL agent Leigh Steinberg spoke to Fox News Digital about why Shedeur Sanders not having an agent may have hurt the quarterback's stock in the recent NFL Draft.
The controversial draft slide of quarterback Shedeur Sanders last month sparked national debate that included a harsh reaction from ESPN's lead draft analyst, Mel Kiper Jr.
Now, Kiper has a supporter in Sanders' father and college coach, Deion Sanders.
Clips of Kiper bashing NFL teams for passing on Shedeur throughout the three-day event were mocked on social media, and the pundit repeatedly praised the quarterback's talent and value.

""I think it's disgusting. I don't understand what the heck's going on with this. ... I don't see, outside of [not having] the rocket arm, 4.6 speed … what is [Shedeur Sanders] lacking? Somebody's gonna have to explain that one to me,"" Kiper exclaimed on air after Sanders fell out of the second round.
Deion praised Kiper.
""But I Love u my man! You stood on the desk with great balance 10 toes down and said what u doggone said & didn’t flinch. You knew what time it was my man & we’re blessed to be right where God wanted us to be. ‘With OPPORTUNITY’ they forgot I was in the tv/entertainment business for 20 years before coaching,"" Sanders wrote in an X post sharing one of Kiper's posts.
NFL AGENT BREAKS DOWN TRUMP'S IMPACT IN SHEDEUR SANDERS SAGA
Kiper's post was in response to a tweet that mentioned criticism of the analyst for ""overshadowing"" the moment when No. 1 overall pick quarterback Cam Ward was selected.
The Tuesday before the draft, NFL Network released a summary of the top 18 prospects in this year's class.
Sanders' section included comments from an anonymous assistant coach who said Sanders was ""the worst formal interview I've ever been in in my life. He's so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates. … But the biggest thing is, he's not that good.""

An anonymous longtime executive added, ""It didn't go great in our interview. He wants to dictate what he's going to do and what's best for him. He makes you feel small.""

Throughout the draft, Kiper's irritation and affection for Sanders became one of the most discussed topics on social media. NBC-owned Pro Football Talk even addressed Kiper's analysis on X.
Sanders was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round with the 144th overall pick after one of the most unprecedented draft slides of a top quarterback prospect in NFL history.

Craig Carton, Danny Parkins, Greg Jennings and John Smoltz discuss Soto’s potential as a Met and if he can lead them to the World Series.
All-Star outfielder Juan Soto spent the 2024 season in the Bronx and was a key part of the New York Yankees run to last year's World Series. In December, he signed a historic contract with New York's other MLB team — the Mets.
Soto's reported 15-year, $765 million deal represents the most lucrative contract in professional sports history. On Friday, the Mets will open a three-game series with the Yankees. The latest edition of the Subway Series will also mark Soto's first time competing at Yankee Stadium since he hung up his pinstripes.

The Minnesota Twins already have had some bad luck being in a dominant AL Central, and their chances of winning the division took a hit on Thursday.
Minnesota entered Thursday at 24-20 and riding a 10-game winning streak – but still in fourth place in the division behind everyone but the Chicago White Sox.
The Twins were on the road in Baltimore to face the struggling Orioles, and they were up 3-0 in the bottom of the third when Cedric Mullins came to the dish.

The O's outfielder hit a blooper into shallow center, that both Carlos Correa at shortstop and Byron Buxton in center field chased down – both running directly toward each other.
Mullins made the catch, but the two ran right into each other, and both lay on the outfield grass for several minutes. Correa left the game while Buxton stayed in before exiting in the fourth. The team said both were in concussion protocol.
Both All-Stars have had their fair share of injuries. Correa has played 140-plus games in a season just twice in his MLB career, and not since 2021, and he played in just 86 games last season.

As for Buxton, the Twins have made him a designated hitter numerous times because he's played in over 100 games just once (last year with 102) since 2018.
Buxton had contributed earlier in the game, hitting back-to-back home runs with DaShawn Keirsey Jr.
Thankfully for Minnesota, Chris Paddack was dominant on the bump, tossing 11 scoreless innings to give Minnesota their 11th consecutive victory.

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/caleb-williams-tried-avoid-getting-drafted-bears-considered-ufl-stint-book-says","Caleb Williams tried to avoid getting drafted by Bears and considered UFL stint, book says","The 2025 NFL Schedule has been released, and Danny Parkins lists his Top 5 games that will impact the season the most, including both matchups between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears.
Eli Manning and John Elway almost had company.
A new book details how Caleb Williams apparently tried to avoid getting drafted by the Chicago Bears last year.
Williams and his family consulted with lawyers to find a loophole in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement, all while his father told the book's author, Seth Wickersham, that ""Chicago is the place quarterbacks go to die.""

Williams himself wondered if he could ""do it"" with Shane Waldron, who has since been fired from his offensive coordinator role. His father, Carl, was also concerned about Matt Eberflus (also since let go as the head coach), and uncertainty within the franchise, along with the fate of previous first-round quarterbacks the organization had selected, that would hold his son back.
""I don't want my son playing for the Bears,"" Carl Williams apparently said. Caleb actually told his dad that he ""needed"" to go to the Minnesota Vikings after meeting with them, knowing how unlikely that would be.
In fact, the quarterback even considered signing into the United Football League out of USC, rather than being the automatic first pick in the NFL.
The details are highlighted in Wickersham's book, ""American Kings: A Biography of the Quarterback,"" which is set to be released in September.
The Bears declined to comment to Fox News Digital.
Fox News Digital reached out to Williams' rep.

Williams eventually stayed in the NFL Draft, and he was convinced after sitting down with Bears brass that he could succeed there. General manager Ryan Poles was not budging, and Williams did not want to pull a Manning from 2004, or Elway in 1983.
He was selected by Chicago to be their next franchise quarterback, and thankfully for the Williamses, a couple of their concerns – the aforementioned Eberflus and Waldron – are no longer in the organization. Former Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson joined the Bears to be their new head coach this offseason. It was a move that Williams was ""extremely excited"" about, to the point where he even thanked Bears brass in a phone call.
""Then once I got off the phone, I was driving on the highway and I don't know if it was safe or not, but I gave a loud yell and scream of just excitement,"" Williams said. ""It brings a bunch of clarity to the offseason. It brings a bunch of different things to the offseason. I'm really excited about the Bears and being able to make this happen. And keep Ben Johnson as our coach for a long time.""
He had an up-and-down rookie season, partially due to the coaching carousel inside the building. He was also sacked 68 times, the most in the NFL. But in all, he ended up with 20 touchdowns, six interceptions, 3,541 passing yards, and 489 rushing yards. His 4,030 total yards were the most by a Bears quarterback ever.

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/former-steelers-star-ryan-clark-weighs-mike-tomlins-coaching-future","Former Steelers star Ryan Clark weighs in on Mike Tomlin's coaching future","James Jones explains why Mike Tomlin needs Aaron Rodgers as the Pittsburgh Steelers ""put themselves in this situation.""
Over his nearly two decades at the helm, Mike Tomlin has coached the Pittsburgh Steelers to a Super Bowl title and consistently been considered one of the NFL's best coaches.
While the Steelers are one of the league's most heralded franchises, the organization has become accustomed to flaming out in the postseason in recent years. Tomlin has been the Steelers' head coach since the 2007 season. He has never ended a regular season with a losing record, but it has now been eight years since he led a team to victory in a playoff game.
Amid Pittsburgh's recent disappointments, former Steelers star and current ESPN NFL analyst Ryan Clark offered his thoughts on Tomlin's coaching future.

Clark began by making it clear Tomlin should not be forced out of his position.
MIKE TOMLIN REFUTES CLAIMS STEELERS ARE 'STUCK,' PUSHES BACK AGAINST POTENTIAL TRADE TO DIFFERENT TEAM
""I believe that Mike Tomlin is unfireable,"" Clark said on ESPN. ""I believe if Mike Tomlin steps away from being the coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, that should be his decision. And I've said time and time again: I do believe that should be the decision that he makes.""

Clark then encouraged his former coach to move on to another NFL team where he could be viewed as a ""fresh voice."" He also suggested the coach's message may no longer resonate with the current players in the Steelers' locker room.
""I believe that Mike Tomlin should coach in another organization,"" Clark continued. ""Mike Tomlin should be a fresh voice somewhere else. Because... as great as a coach as he is, and he's a first-ballot Hall of Famer, I believe his voice has run stale there. I believe he's allowed that team to reach the highest of heights they're gonna reach, unless they can get a top-tier quarterback.""

The level of quarterback play the Steelers get in the 2025 season will likely have a considerable impact on their success. Pittsburgh's quarterback room currently features players with more questions than answers.
Mason Rudolph left the Steelers after the 2023 season and joined the Tennessee Titans. The quarterback threw nine touchdowns against nine interceptions over eight games in 2024. Aside from Rudolph, Skylar Thompson and rookie Will Howard are the only other quarterbacks under contract with the Steelers.

Howard led Ohio State to the national championship in January. Pittsburgh drafted him in the sixth round last month.
The Steelers have shown interest in veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The four-time NFL MVP has met with the Steelers' front office and coaches, but he has yet to make an official decision about his football future.

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-schedule-release-reveals-brutal-path-3-teams-2025","NFL schedule release reveals brutal path for these 3 teams in 2025","The Kansas City Chiefs will play the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 1 of the NFL season in São Paulo. Colin Cowherd predicts that the Chargers will win the AFC West, and that their ‘soft’ schedule will help them.
The NFL released the schedules for all 32 teams on Wednesday, and some have it a little tougher than others this season.
The NFL does not have a balanced schedule, which is why some teams will see tougher or easier schedules regardless of how they did last season.
Trying to predict the strength of a schedule is an inexact science because teams do change a lot from season to season, whether that would be in free agency, the NFL Draft or changes to the front office and coaching staff.

Regardless, here are the three teams whose 2025 opponents have the highest combined win percentage from the 2024 season and have a gauntlet of a schedule.
Despite a dreadful 3-14 season that nearly cost general manager Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll their jobs, the Giants have the hardest schedule in football.
The Giants' opponents for the upcoming season have a combined .574 winning percentage. The NFC East is set to play both the NFC North and AFC West this season, and both divisions harbor three teams that made the playoffs last season.
The beginning of the Giants' schedule is particularly rough, as six of their first eight games are against playoff teams from last season.

Below is the Giants' schedule:
Caleb Williams’ second year with the Bears will be a challenge, as their opponents had a combined winning percentage of .571.
Every team in the NFC North except for the Bears made the playoffs last season, and the Bears will match up against each of their division foes twice this season.
In addition to the usual six games against their division rivals, the NFC North is taking on the NFC East and AFC North this season. The NFC East holds the Super Bowl champion Eagles and the Commanders, who were knocked out by Philadelphia in the NFC Championship game.
The AFC North had two playoff teams last season in the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers, and that doesn’t include the Cincinnati Bengals, who just narrowly missed out on the playoffs.

Below is the Bears’ schedule:
The Lions, like the Bears, are in the NFC North and most of their opponents overlap, so both teams’ opponents have a combined winning percentage of .571.
The Lions went an outstanding 15-2 last season, but will face a much taller task in 2025 to have the same record.
In addition to having a difficult schedule, the team lost both coordinators from last year’s team. Offensive coordinator Ben Johnson took the Bears’ head coaching job, while defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn is now the New York Jets’ head coach.

Boston Red Sox outfielders Wilyer Abreu and Ceddanne Rafaela combined for the rare 9-8 putout in the team’s 6-5 loss to the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday at Comerica Park.
With the score tied 5-5 in the bottom of the seventh inning, Tigers designated hitter Kerry Carpenter crushed a high fastball off of Liam Hendriks deep to right-center field.
Abreu, the Red Sox's right fielder, tracked the ball as he moved back to the wall. Abreu leaped and got his glove on it, but could not haul it in, and the ball bounced off his glove back into the field of play as it was set to go over the wall for a go-ahead home run for Carpenter.

Rafaela, the Red Sox's center fielder, ran over to back up Abreu, and the ball caromed off of Abreu’s glove and right to Rafaela.
Rafaela reacted and grabbed the ball with his bare hand and then put it into his glove for the out.
Upon the catch, Rafaela hoisted the glove above his head and showed the ball while Abreu celebrated the improbable play by high-fiving Rafaela.
Hendriks lifted his arms up in disbelief, as the Red Sox outfielders not only brought a home run back into play but turned it into an out.

The last 9-8 putout before the Red Sox on Wednesday was on Sept. 14, 2003, when the Minnesota Twins’ Michael Ryan lost the ball in the sun, and it hit off his head and Dustan Mohr caught it.
While the Tigers were kept off the scoreboard in the seventh inning by the miraculous play by Abreu and Rafaela, they were not denied in the ninth inning.
Red Sox reliever Aroldis Chapman walked the lead-off hitter Andy Ibanez, who then stole second base. Tigers’ manager AJ Hinch then sent Justyn-Henry Malloy to pinch hit, and he delivered.

The Indianapolis Colts came under fire on Wednesday night for a since-deleted social media video that was intended to creatively reveal the team's 2025 game schedule.
The clip, which was animated in the style of the Microsoft-owned video game Minecraft, opened with a segment previewing the team's Week 1 game against the Miami Dolphins. In it, Dolphins star Tyreek Hill was depicted as a dolphin and was then approached by a Coast Guard boat blaring a police siren, with a police officer glaring at Hill.
Hill was arrested in September in a widely publicized controversy that featured bodycam footage of the wide receiver being pinned to the ground by police while put in handcuffs.

The Colts deleted the video later that evening and have since provided a statement to Fox New Digital clarifying that it was deleted due to the Hill depiction and because it violated the team's agreement with Microsoft.
""We removed our schedule release video because it exceeded our rights with Microsoft and included an insensitive clip involving Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill. We sincerely apologize to Microsoft and Tyreek,"" the team said on Thursday.

Hill himself weighed in on the situation with an X post on Wednesday, saying the Colts should have left the video up.
The Los Angeles Chargers also formatted their schedule release video with Minecraft. However, unlike the Colts, the Chargers video included a disclaimer at the very start.
Also, unlike the Colts' video, the Chargers' video appears to be actual recorded gameplay of Minecraft, while Indianapolis used proprietary animation.

New York Knicks guard Josh Hart was busted open early in the team’s Game 5 loss to the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night.

Still, Hart led the Knicks with 24 points in a losing effort.
""Eye’s peachy,"" Hart told reporters following the 127-105 loss, via the New York Post.
It was far from the only intense incident of the night. Hart and Jaylen Brown got tied up in the third quarter and needed to be separated. The two got into a pushing contest after Brown got caught on a Hart screen.
""It was just two guys that are extremely competitive,"" Hart said. ""He’s a passionate, competitive player. We were tied at halftime, he’s trying to give their team a spark and momentum and the same thing with me.""

ESPN’s NFL Draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. and Miami Hurricanes football coach Mario Cristobal were in a war of words on Wednesday over coverage of quarterback Cam Ward.
The Tennessee Titans selected the one-time Heisman Trophy contender with the No. 1 overall pick of the draft last month. It was the easiest selection the Titans could have made, and it arguably went under-covered as Shedeur Sanders’ draft slide began as the Jacksonville Jaguars traded up with the Cleveland Browns to select Travis Hunter with the No. 2 pick.

Kiper faced criticism during the three days of the draft as he harped on the surprise of Sanders’ fall and even had an on-air tiff with Rece Davis once the Browns eventually selected the quarterback in the fifth round.
Cristobal said neither he nor offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson spoke to Kiper about Ward, even though he spoke to a ""million people,"" according to The Action Network.
""Never heard from him,"" the coach said. ""I don’t think I’ve ever talked to him.""
Cristobal added that he was not ""disappointed"" and would only be if Ward was upset. He expressed confidence that Ward just wanted to hear his name called and get to work.

Interesting isn’t it,"" he wrote on X. ""And oh by the way, I didn’t speak to Deion about Shedeur either. I need another Orange Crush after this nonsense.""
It was Kiper’s first post on the social media platform since April 23, and it appeared Sanders’ fall still stuck with him.

With Pope Leo XIV assuming his post, college football coaching legend Lou Holtz shared an important message for every Catholic around the globe.
Holtz said he has been ""Catholic all my life,"" serving as an altar boy as well. He urged people in the United States and around the world to be gracious to Pope Leo as he begins his leadership of the church.
""I’m an old man, I’ve been Catholic all my life. I was taught about how the pope would be selected. The white smoke, the black smoke, et cetera,"" Holtz began his message. ""But you never know about the pope, because he isn’t infallible. He’s infallible when everything comes to religious decisions, and we’re taught to respect him and pray for him and listen to him.

""I hope this pope will be a very, very good one, but I do know this: He is our pope. We must defend him, we must encourage him, we must pray for him, and we must help him.""
Holtz continued by arguing ""too many people don’t give enough to the church today,"" and perhaps that is due to some not believing in past papal decisions.
""The church has financial obligations like anything else. So, whether you like the pope or not, is irrelevant. He’s our pope. You must respect him, pray for him, and care about him at the same time, accept the decisions he makes.
MEDIA POSITIONS POPE LEO XIV AS POTENTIAL 'COUNTERWEIGHT' TO TRUMP
""It’s important for us to support the pope regardless of who he is, whether we like him or not. Pray for him. Pray for the decisions that they make. I’ve been blessed to know two popes, have visits with them. Let’s make sure that we pray for the pope, follow his blessings and teachings because they’ve led us the correct way for so many years.
""Good luck to you, and I promise you, I will pray for the pope because I know the pope’s also going to pray for me and pray for the choices he makes in the best interest of this country.""
Since Cardinal Robert Prevost was elected as the first American pope last week, many wanted to learn about the new leader of the church.

Louis Prevost, his conservative brother, pushed back on accusations that Pope Leo would be a ""woke"" successor to the late Pope Francis.
""He wasn’t, like, super political,"" Prevost told Piers Morgan on ""Uncensored."" ""He’s not left, he’s not right, he looks at the whole scene, takes information from both sides, and somehow finds a way to go down the middle and not ruffle too many feathers.""
Prevost did, however, address Pope Leo’s previous criticism of President Donald Trump’s methods amid the migrant crisis.
""He may take offense with the method in which they’re moving people out and comment on that,"" but nonetheless, ""you still have to follow the rules of the law.""

He pointed to each of the umpires standing around him and ""tossed"" all of them out of the game. He got more words with one of the umpires before heading back to the clubhouse.
Lovullo said after the game the theatrics were only for show. He said the obstruction call had been the right one.
""They’re really good,"" Lovullo said. ""Umpires are good. I stand corrected.""
Lovullo’s matinée kick-started when Giants infielder Christian Koss advanced to second base on a grounder from Helio Ramos. He rounded second before he collided with Diamondbacks' Jordan Lawlar. Koss was tagged out for what would have ended the inning.

However, the umpires decided that Lawlar obstructed the play. Lovullo came out of the dugout and started to yell at first-base umpire Mark Ripperger. He eventually threw out the manager.
""In the heat of the moment,"" Lovullo explained, ""it wasn’t adding up to me and I felt like they were just trying to cover themselves a little bit. But in reality, there was obstruction called.
""I was trying to do the math and I didn’t know how the third-base umpire (Nic Lentz) could be watching a fair-foul ball and then the throw get off and still see obstruction. But he pointed to it, and he had it.""

The Cincinnati Reds paid tribute to Pete Rose on Wednesday night – one day after Major League Baseball removed the all-time hits leader and others from the permanently ineligible list.
Reds fans packed the city en route to Great American Ballpark to watch the team celebrate one of the best players in the franchise’s history as he will get a chance to have a plaque in Cooperstown, New York, in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Chants of ""Pete! Pete!"" were heard throughout the park. The stadium held a pregame moment of silence and a choir from Rose’s high school in Cincinnati performed the national anthem. Fans wore Rose jerseys and highlights were shown on the video board throughout the game.
""It was awesome,"" Pete Rose Jr. said of the ceremony, via MLB.com. ""It’s home. These are all friends and family. I drove 15 minutes from home to get to the ballpark. I will drive 15 minutes back. I try to explain to people, they don’t really get the aspect of Dad being here. I try to tell them he’s our Babe Ruth. If you’re from here, he’s our Babe Ruth.""
He added that the family could not have asked ""for a better night.""

Rose was placed on the ineligible list after the revelation that he gambled on the Reds to win – both as a player and a manager. After years of claiming innocence, Rose admitted to gambling in 2004. He also faced accusations of sexual misconduct in the years after he retired from the game.

He lamented in his final interview that he would only get into the Hall of Fame after he died. It is a prophecy that took one step closer to reality on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, however, he was celebrated.

""My dad used to tell me all the stories of how hard he played every time,"" Reds reliever Brent Suter said. ""You know, never took a play off, always was running hard 90 (feet), sliding headfirst, you know, getting dirty every game. ... This was a guy who just embodied toughness, grit.""
Reds manager Terry Francona also spoke of Rose. He was a teammate of Rose’s with Cincinnati and the Montreal Expos.
""He played baseball with as much passion and competitive enjoyment as you ever could,"" he said. ""You wanted to be on his team.""
Now, the debate begins over whether Rose should be in the Hall of Fame and whether it was right to keep him out for as long as baseball did.

John Cena has embarked on the last few months of his career.
In that time, he won the Elimination Chamber, aligned himself with The Rock and defeated Cody Rhodes for the Undisputed WWE Championship at WrestleMania 41.
Cena opened up about his personal life and the time he spends outside the ring with his wife, Shay Shariatzadeh.

""Honestly it could be so simple,"" Cena told Us Weekly at Amazon Upfronts. ""Put your f’n phone at home. Not in your pocket, I don’t even bring it with me. You only need one person to dial 911, so only one phone, that way we’re both present. And when you’re there, you’re there.
""If your mind is scattered, and you’re not ready yet, take like a 5-minute (break), tell the person you’re with like ‘man I don’t know if I’m in the headspace to be here’, but when you’re there, you’re there.""

Cena has been back in the WWE fold since the start of the year. He appeared in the Royal Rumble and finished as runner-up to Jey Uso. He won the men’s Elimination Chamber match to earn a title shot against Rhodes and surprisingly turned heel to become the antagonist nobody saw coming.

The Atlanta Falcons are in the lead for the biggest jab thrown in a schedule release video.
All 32 NFL teams' schedules were released on Wednesday night, and over the years, it has become commonplace for teams to make a video to coincide with, and announce, their schedule.
Well, the Falcons did just that with a Mario Kart 64 theme.

The video started out with Falcons players, including Bijan Robinson, Drake London and Michael Penix Jr. as playable characters for ""ATL Kart.""
The video then pays homage to a famous track in the game, ""Toad's Turnpike,"" with the city of Atlanta and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in the background.
Atlanta-based rapper Ludacris then counts down the race, and as the race goes on, other drivers that feature their opponents show up on the screen.
As they head to another course, the video then takes a wild, unexpected turn. While racing on the beach, the video then pans to two characters, seemingly portrayed as Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson, with a sign that reads, ""We're not talking about this.""

TRAVIS KELCE UPSET ABOUT CHIEFS' WEEK 1 GAME IN BRAZIL
Those words, of course, were uttered by Hudson while Belichick was asked in a CBS interview how they met. The interview turned into headlines and back-and-forth statements between Belichick and CBS.
Belichick interviewed for the Falcons job last year, but it was ultimately given to Raheem Morris. He took the head coaching job at UNC this past December.
There also may have been a shot at Tom Brady and the DeflateGate scandal - when the Falcons revealed that they would face the New England Patriots, the Pats character's car's tires went flat beside a ""Free Air"" sign.

The 2025 NFL schedule has been released, and FOX’s booth of Kevin Burkhardt and Tom Brady have quite the matchups to call for ""America’s Game of the Week.""
Brady joined the Burkhardt team, which included Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi, for the 2024 season. The quartet is back for another exciting slate of games that starts with a Super Bowl rematch.
The Philadelphia Eagles are traveling to Arrowhead Stadium to face the Kansas City Chiefs, the team they defeated, 40-22 in Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans. That game will kick off in Week 2.

From there, the crew will call the following games:
So, after seeing who comes out on top between the two conference winners in 2024, Dak Prescott and his new receiver George Pickens will head to the ""Windy City"" to face Caleb Williams and his expected new-look offense under head coach Ben Johnson, who led the Lions’ dynamic bunch as their offensive coordinator last year.

Additionally, of course, some classic divisional rivalries are in the slate, including a good Thanksgiving Day matchup between the Jordan Love-led Packers and Lions. The NFC East will also be featured with the Week 12 and Week 18 games.
The Lions, as well as the Cowboys, will be the most featured teams for ""America’s Game of the Week,"" as they will each play four times.
It is also worth pointing out how the Commanders, who made it to the NFC Championship Game last season, are now thrust into the position of being a playoff contender moving forward under the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year, quarterback Jayden Daniels.
Perhaps the Giants, a team with a brand-new quarterbacks room which includes Russell Wilson, Jameis Winston and first-rounder Jaxson Dart, can find themselves in the same position as Washington this season.

Now, Indianapolis does not have any video for its schedule release on social media, while all 31 other teams in the league have posted theirs.
No official reason was given by the Colts for the deletion of the video. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Colts for comment.

Hill was arrested in September by Miami-Dade police officers before a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars for speeding, reckless driving and not wearing a seat belt.
Police bodycam footage of Hill's arrest went viral shortly after it occurred and heightened the scope of the controversy. The footage showed Hill being originally pulled over for speeding while approaching Hard Rock Stadium.
Hill was told by an officer to roll down his window, and he handed the officer his driver's license and repeatedly told the officer not to knock on his window. The footage also shows the officer asking Hill to keep his window down. The incident escalated when Hill didn't comply. The wide receiver was handcuffed and placed face down on a street by officers.

Hill was released after about 25 minutes, when his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, arrived.

Former Major League Baseball (MLB) starter Trevor Bauer took Pete Rose’s reinstatement as another avenue to jab the league.
The controversial hurler posted on social media Wednesday, just one day after MLB announced Rose and other deceased ballplayers were taken off the permanently ineligible list, to continue taking shots at the league as he remains out of it.
""So, since Pete is welcome back now, does that go for everyone who has been blackballed?"" Bauer asked on X. ""Or do you actually have to be guilty of something to qualify for that?""

Bauer is currently pitching in Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball League. He has been out of MLB for the past four years.
The reason revolves around sexual assault allegations that were raised against him in 2021. MLB initially placed Bauer on administrative leave, but he was later suspended 324 games before having that reduced to 194 games after an appeal.
His suspension may be up, but no MLB team has brought Bauer back into the fold. Bauer has never been one to shy away from sharing his thoughts, and he was not going to in this case.
Bauer suggested this past August that MLB is the reason he cannot sign with another team – not because a team does not believe his talent is still there to perform at the big-league level.
CONGRESSMAN SAYS MLB IS OUSTING TREVOR BAUER DUE TO TRUMP SUPPORT, IN LETTER TO ROB MANFRED
""Well, one team told us it’s not their decision, it’s an MLB decision,"" Bauer wrote on X at the time. He was exchanging with Cincinnati Reds fans on the social media platform.
""One team told me I was ‘too expensive’ even though I offered to play for minimum, another team told us they have covered some stuff up in the past that they don’t want the media digging into to find out about…"" Bauer added.

An MLB spokesperson said in a statement to Mail Sport that Bauer could sign with any of the 30 ball clubs.
""Trevor Bauer served the entirety of his discipline and is an unrestricted free agent available to sign a contract with any team,"" the statement read.
Bauer was never charged with a crime. His accuser sought a restraining order against him, but it was denied. Los Angeles prosecutors said in February 2022 that there was insufficient evidence to prove the woman’s accusations beyond reasonable doubt.
Bauer sued his accuser in federal court in April 2022, a move that came less than three months after prosecutors decided not to file criminal charges against the pitcher.

Another woman from Columbus, Ohio, told The Washington Post that Bauer repeatedly choked her without her consent and sexually assaulted her over the course of a yearslong relationship. Bauer, in a statement through his representatives, said their relationship was ""casual and wholly consensual.""
Bauer spent the 2023 campaign in NPB in Japan, while playing for Diablos Rojos del Mexico in March 2024.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
It's been over two decades since an American men's tennis player won a Grand Slam, but Andre Agassi thinks the drought could end soon.
Agassi and Andy Roddick both took home a Grand Slam in 2003, but the United States has come up empty-handed ever since.
Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have since taken over the sport, rewriting the history books in the process. Pete Sampras won all 14 of his Grand Slams before those three even won their first.
Since then, all they've done is blow by Sampras. Federer has 20, Nadal 22 and Djokovic 24.

""It's interesting. We've been spoiled in years past. [John] McEnroe, [Jimmy] Conners, Andy Roddick. But the truth is there have been three guys who have been pretty damn gritty for a long time in Rafa, Novak,= and Feds,"" Agassi noted in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.
Agassi made sure to mention that the United States has its share of stars. Taylor Fritz is ranked fourth; Tommy Paul and Ben Shelton are ranked 12th and 13th, respectively; Frances Tiafoe is 16th; and Sebastian Korda is 23rd.
And Agassi believes courts filled with American players could fuel other Americans to finally get over the hump.

""One thing I can say from experience is I needed Pete, and I needed Jim [Courier]. We each helped the other one believe something was possible. … I think these guys, when we look at these big stadiums and these big moments, I'm seeing you on the other side of the net, it makes me believe I belong here,"" Agassi said.
""I'm hoping that's the crux we need. I think Ben Shelton has such a huge upside. That's what's great about tennis. It's gladiators, and you gotta figure it out day to day,"" he said.
Since 2004, there have been 84 Grand Slams played (there was no Wimbledon in 2020), and the big three of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic combined to win 65 of them. Of the remaining 19, 13 were won by Andy Murray (three), Stan Wawrinka (three), Jannik Sinner (three) and Carlos Alcaraz (four). No one else in that period has won more than one.

Malaki Starks got the best of both worlds on draft night.
Sure, everyone wants to be an early selection, but more often than not, that leads to landing on a subpar team. While Starks was not a top-20 pick, he still heard his name called in the first round, and he now calls a Super Bowl contender his new home.

The defensive back was selected by the Baltimore Ravens with the 27th pick late last month, who two seasons ago were in the AFC Championship. This past season, they were oh-so close to getting back.
This year figures to be similar for Baltimore, as long as they have MVP candidate Lamar Jackson at the helm.
The difference in skill from college to the NFL does not need explaining, but Starks said there is another concern on his mind in the leap to the pros.
""There are a lot of rules that are a lot different than it is in college,"" Starks told Fox News Digital. ""The dimensions, I’m still used to the hashed being farther in. I spent time after practices walking through my steps because I’m so programmed to go to a certain spot. Just really relearning all the rules, dimensions, things like that.""

However, Starks has ""a good group of elite guys"" to learn from.
Starks has been a part of a perennial winner for a long while. He spent his college days at Georgia. And ahead of the draft, he did even more winning while teaming up with Tide to participate in their Laundry Games alongside Spice Adams and fellow draftee Matthew Golden.
""We did this thing where you had a laundry thing on your head and had to balance it walking back and forth. Matthew couldn’t do it. I got to rub it in his face,"" Starks joked.
""People think prep starts on the field, but it actually starts in the laundry room. You feel good when you look good.""
Perhaps Starks may feel some added pressure, though, given his team's expectations. However, being a Bulldog, that is already instilled in him.

Nick Wright disputes the claim the lottery is rigged.
Chicago hosted the NBA's annual draft lottery Monday night. Despite entering the lottery with 1.8% odds, the Dallas Mavericks landed the top selection for the upcoming draft.
The Dallas Wings won the WNBA Draft lottery and landed the top selection in last month's draft.
Paige Bueckers was the first player off the board.
The former UConn basketball star said she was shocked by the Mavs' good fortune in the lottery.

""That's another thing that I didn't think was real at first,"" Bueckers said, according to The Dallas Morning News.
Bueckers said there was reason Dallas' NBA franchise landed the No. 1 pick.
""But I believe God makes no mistakes, so that happened for a reason,"" she suggested.
Duke standout Cooper Flagg is widely projected as the top prospect in this year's NBA Draft.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Pete Rose and his family repeatedly tried to get MLB's all-time hit king back into baseball without success.
On Tuesday, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred announced anyone on baseball's ineligible list would be removed from the list at the time of their deaths.
It meant Rose's ban from baseball had been lifted, making him eligible for Hall of Fame consideration.

The announcement came just over 24 hours before Rose's Cincinnati Reds hosted Pete Rose Night, a celebration previously scheduled for the legend who died in September.
Members of Rose's family and other Reds greats were at the pregame ceremony, and Rose's daughter, Fawn, shared her reaction to the news.
""Coming off yesterday's news, we were boarding a plane in Seattle, and I got a phone call at about 10:15. And I got a phone call from our attorney. … I so wanted to be the one standing here at this podium and announcing that the ban had been lifted, but I'm so happy we can again celebrate that tonight. One step at a time. One step at a time,"" she said.
Fawn Rose then praised the commissioner for his discussions about her father when the family met with Manfred shortly after Pete Rose died.
""The emotion was overwhelming. I called [Pete Jr.]. My kids thought someone died because I got emotional at the airport, but it was a big deal. And during my meeting with the commissioner, the commissioner was so grateful,"" she said.

""He was gracious, kind, really gave me a forum to talk about my dad — not the baseball player, but the father, the grandfather and, really, what he means to the fans of Cincinnati. And I was able to take from that visitation here in Cincinnati and express to the commissioner the overwhelming feeling of love and gratitude from my dad and what he gave to this city. This city was my dad, and my brother said Cincinnati baseball, it's in our DNA. We're West Siders.""
Other players now eligible include ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson and the rest of the 1919 Black Sox. Overall, 17 players are now baseball eligible.
Rose admitted to gambling in 2004 after years of claiming his innocence. He died in September and predicted 10 days before his death he would not make the Hall of Fame until after he died, if at all.

In 1991, two years after Rose was banned by A. Bartlett Giamatti, the National Baseball Hall of Fame voted to make those ineligible from baseball ineligible for potential induction into Cooperstown.
It is not yet official when Rose will be up for a vote, but it will likely be up to the Classic Baseball Era Committee, which considers players whose careers ended more than 15 years ago. That committee does not meet until December 2027, and he would need 12 of the 16 votes to get in.

Craig Carton, Danny Parkins and Mark Schlereth discuss Bosa’s potential impact on the Bills and why his availability could be a concern.
NFL schedule release videos are always fun to see each year, and the Buffalo Bills are always among the teams thinking outside the box.
This year, the Bills had the ultimate play on words when their video began with general manager Brandon Beane calling MVP quarterback Josh Allen, asking if he had any ideas for how to release the schedule.
""Just use AI,"" Allen told Beane. ""That’s what everybody’s doing.""

Artificial intelligence has become a useful tool, but what Allen was doing to start the video hinted at how Beane took his suggestion.
Allen was shooting basketballs instead of throwing footballs, and Beane channeled a different AI.

Beane called NBA Hall of Fame point guard Allen Iverson, nicknamed ""AI.""
""Yeah, I don’t know what I’m doing,"" Iverson told Beane over a web call. ""Why am I here?""
""We do want you to reveal the Buffalo Bills’ 2025 schedule,"" Beane replied.
Iverson liked that Allen was the player who gave Beane the idea, though he did ask if the quarterback meant using artificial intelligence.
""You’re the only AI I know,"" Beane answered.

So, Iverson obliged and was happy to do so. He held up a piece of paper with all 17 games and the bye week listed.
While Iverson did the schedule release, he wasn’t thrilled with Beane's final request.
""Can I get a ‘Go Bills?’"" Beane asked.
""Go Josh Allen,"" Iverson, a die-hard Dallas Cowboys fan, replied with a smile.

While his Boston Celtics will be fighting to keep their season alive Wednesday night, Jayson Tatum underwent successful surgery to repair an Achilles tendon that ruptured in a Game 4 loss to the New York Knicks.
Tatum’s road to recovery begins now, and he spoke for the first time since he was injured in the fourth quarter of Game 4, which could result in him missing the entire 2025-26 NBA season.
Tatum posted a picture of himself in a hospital bed after surgery with a thumbs-up.

""Thankful for all the love and supporter (prayer emoji),"" Tatum wrote in an Instagram caption.
The Celtics posted their own screenshot of Tatum, saying, ""the comeback will be greater than the setback.""

Tatum was having his best playoff performance of 2025, scoring 42 points on 16 of 28 shooting with seven made 3-pointers against the Knicks in Game 4. He also had eight rebounds, four assists and four steals.
Boston was down at the time of the injury, and Tatum tried planting on his right foot to go after a loose ball, but he immediately hit the floor writhing in pain.

Tatum was helped off the court by Celtics staff, and the Madison Square Garden crowd applauded in a show of respect as he made his way to the locker room. MRI results the next day confirmed what the team feared. Tatum had a torn Achilles that required surgery.
It will be a long journey back for Tatum, who will likely make his fourth straight All-NBA first team. He starred in the Celtics' NBA Finals win over the Dallas Mavericks last season.
The Celtics were hoping to go back-to-back, and though many believed they would cruise past the Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals, Boston blew two 20-point deficits in Games 1 and 2 to fall into a 2-0 hole.

Cooper Flagg is one of the most hyped prospects in recent NBA history, but he says the hype wasn't always there.
The Duke phenom and projected No. 1 pick in the upcoming NBA Draft told The Associated Press that, growing up, he was told he would never achieve his basketball goals.
Flagg said the doubts were due to where he was from.
""Growing up in Maine, there’s people that told me I would never be able to make it to the next level or play Division I basketball because I’m from Maine and nobody plays up there,"" Flagg said. ""I think just that message of it doesn’t matter where you’re from, as long as you work hard and trust yourself and trust your ability, then you can really accomplish anything.""

Very few basketball stars have come from Maine. Miami Heat player Duncan Robinson was born in Maine, but he grew up in New Hampshire and went undrafted in the 2018 draft.
The most prominent player to come out of Maine was former Olympic gold medalist Jeff Turner, who played for Vanderbilt in the early 1980s and played in the NBA from 1984-96. But he was out of the NBA from 1986-89 while playing in Italy.
Flagg is expected to become the most talented basketball player to come out of the state in its history.

Flagg led Duke this season in almost every statistical category, including points (709), rebounds (278), assists (155), steals (52) and blocks per game (1.4). He averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.4 blocks and 1.4 steals, but his best showing was in January when he set an ACC freshman record with a 42-point performance against Notre Dame.
Flagg closed out the year with a semifinal appearance in the NCAA Tournament and was named the winner of the 2025 Naismith Player of the Year Award, becoming just the fourth freshman to win that honor.

I mean, honestly, for me, it wasn’t real until I was in high school, but I always loved the game of basketball. I always put the work in. I always wanted to be the best that I could be.""
The Dallas Mavericks are expected to draft Flagg after winning the first pick in the 2025 NBA Draft Lottery.

Colin Cowherd discusses Belichick’s rebranding attempts and how UNC can be an NFL springboard.
North Carolina football coach Bill Belichick appears to remain cemented in athletic director Lawrence R. ""Bubba"" Cunningham's good graces.
Cunningham's department recently denied reports saying Belichick's girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, was effectively banned from UNC's athletics department and team buildings.
On Tuesday, Cunningham shared some details about the working relationship he's built with the former NFL coach.

""Bill's been great to work with,"" Cunningham told ESPN. ""He talked about practicing like a pro, and he runs a professional organization that is teaching students how to be professional in all aspects of their life. He is a very determined, professional individual, and that's the way he carries himself and the way he conducts the program.""
PRESSURE RAMPS UP ON KEY BILL BELICHICK DATE AMID SCRUTINY ON RELATIONSHIP
While Cunningham was willing to go into detail about Belichick's football-related relationships, he was less forthcoming when questions were raised about Belichick's personal life. When Cunningham was asked a question suggesting Hudson's presence created ""distractions,"" he sidestepped, saying, ""Bill is an incredibly focused person.""

""It’s a personal relationship, and she doesn’t have anything to do with UNC football,"" Belichick said.

The discussion also marked the 73-year-old's first televised interview since his infamous sitdown with ""CBS News Sunday Morning.""
The interview was part of a promotional tour for Belichick's new book, ""The Art of Winning — Lessons from My Life in Football."" At times during the conversation, Hudson was accused of attempting to assert her control.

Hudson also faced criticism over her reported involvement in North Carolina losing out on the opportunity to be featured on HBO's ""Hard Knocks."" According to The Athletic, Hudson played an ""instrumental role"" in HBO pulling the plug on the potential production of the UNC-focused docuseries.
The report also noted that Hudson had asked to be ""heavily involved with the project.""
Belichick has been publicly linked to the 24-year-old Hudson since 2023. In a statement released after the CBS interview, Belichick said he met Hudson on a flight in 2021.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Seattle Mariners star center fielder Julio Rodríguez opened the team’s game with a sensational catch against the New York Yankees Wednesday at T-Mobile Park.
Yankees center fielder Trent Grisham led off for the Yankees, and he struck a high fastball deep into center field off Mariners starting pitcher Luis Castillo.
Rodríguez went back to the wall and tracked the deep fly ball beautifully, leaping and reaching with his glove over the wall to take a home run away from Grisham.

The 24-year-old center fielder was fired up after his grab and pumped his fist before firing the ball back into the infield. Castillo showed his appreciation for the epic play, pounding his glove toward Rodríguez.
While Rodríguez may have taken a home run away from Grisham Wednesday, he may have given the Yankees center fielder an assist on a home run earlier in the series.
In the Yankees' 11-5 win Monday, Grisham hit a deep fly ball to center field, and Rodríguez scampered back to the wall and jumped to try and make the play. But he missed the ball.

Not only did he miss it, but the ball bounced off Rodríguez's glove and over the wall for a Grisham home run.
That home run was the first of two blasts for Grisham in the Yankees’ win Monday. His second blast was also to center field, but Rodríguez did not have a chance to make a play on that 415-foot blast.
The Yankees won the first game of the three-game series, and the Mariners won the second game, 2-1, in extra innings Tuesday.

Scottie Scheffler is either the ultimate troll, or this was a pure coincidence.
In any case, the two-time Masters champion's outfit at Quail Hollow Golf Club Wednesday got some reaction on social media.
Scheffler is the favorite to take home this year's PGA Championship at the famed Charlotte course, and Saturday will mark one year since he was arrested on his way to the tournament when it was at Valhalla.

Scheffler's mugshot, in which he wore an orange jumpsuit, quickly went viral. He was released and made it to his tee time, shooting a 66. Xander Schauffele eventually took home the Wanamaker Trophy.
In his final practice round before this year's tournament, Scheffler wore a color similar to the jumpsuit he wore this time last year.
""I was freaking out because I somehow went from driving to the golf course to a jail cell, and I still don't really know how that happened exactly. I don't think it really ever felt real,"" Scheffler told producers of the third season of ""Full Swing.""

RORY MCILROY TALKS COLDNESS TOWARD BRYSON DECHAMBEAU DURING MASTERS
Scheffler attended the University of Texas. So, maybe he was just repping the Longhorns. Or, again, pure coincidence.
The incident occurred after a fatal accident outside the Louisville course. Scheffler was trying to get to the clubhouse before officers stopped him.
Scheffler faced four charges, including assaulting a police officer. Less than two weeks later, all the charges against Scheffler were dropped, and he called it a ""big misunderstanding.""
""I did spend some time stretching in a jail cell. That was a first for me,"" Scheffler joked after his round the day of his arrest.

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/colorado-school-district-sue-state-over-policy-allows-trans-athletes-girls-sports","Colorado school district suing state over policy that allows trans athletes in girls sports","OutKick host Riley Gaines and former GOP Michigan gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon analyze a DOGE hearing on transgender athletes in women's sports on 'Hannity.'
A school district in Colorado is suing the state's athletic association and attorney general over the state's laws requiring schools to allow biologically male transgender athletes to compete in girls sports.
School District 49 (D49) in El Paso County, Colorado, joined a growing list of school districts in states that allow trans athletes to compete in girls sports by changing its own policy to ensure female-only participation.
But D49 is going a step further with preemptive legal action after observing ""increasing tension between Title IX obligations and the state system that requires discrimination against female student-athletes,"" according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM
""Knowing that the approved policy would generate opposition and potentially trigger legal challenges, D49 filed a pre-enforcement action in the Colorado District of the federal court system seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,"" the school district said.
The lawsuit takes aim at the Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA) and Attorney General Philip J. Weiser and seeks legal protection for its new policy to protect girls sports.
The lawsuit does not come in response to a specific incident of a trans athlete competing in the district. Instead, it's a response to the state's sweeping policies conflicting with the school's obligation to abide by federal law, specifically Title IX.
""Political culture is far out of balance on gender issues. Our lawsuit seeks a rational correction to excessive accommodations,"" D49 Superinterdent Peter Hilts told Fox News Digital. ""Our state athletic association simultaneously advocates equity and discrimination. We asked them to resolve that discrepancy, and they declined, so we were compelled to pursue a legal ruling.""
MAINE ROCKED BY TRANS ATHLETE DOMINANCE AT GIRLS' TRACK MEET AMID ONGOING LEGAL CONFLICT WITH TRUMP
Lori Thompson, president of the School District 49 Board of Education, lamented the state's current policies and their effects on competition among girls.
""Current Colorado law requires us to violate Title IX by taking opportunities from deserving girls and delivering them to boys,"" Thompson told Fox News Digital.
Colorado is one of the many blue states to protect the rights of trans athletes in girls sports.

Students in the state can compete in either gender category if they inform their school in writing that their gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. CHSAA requires schools to do a confidential evaluation, and all forms of documentation are voluntary. There are also no medical or legal requirements stated.
Weiser's office responded to the lawsuit in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.
""The attorney general is committed to defending Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws. The attorney general’s office has no further comment on this ongoing litigation,"" the statement said.
The CHSAA says it is aware of the lawsuit, but it has not yet been officially served, a spokesperson told Fox News Digital.
""Should official notice be received, we will organize our team accordingly and proceed through the appropriate legal channels,"" the spokesperson added.
A representative for the legal firm Miller Farmer Carlson, representing D49, said the document has not been served due to a lack of correspondence from CHSAA.
""The counsel for CHSAA, Alex Halpern, has not responded to our requests to waive service. Unless he does so by tomorrow, we will then just go ahead and serve their registered agent,"" said Brad Miller.

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/stephen-a-smith-lists-cooper-flaggs-race-reason-draft-him","Stephen A. Smith mentions Cooper Flagg's race as a reason to draft him","Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Dallas Mavericks won the Cooper Flagg sweepstakes earlier this week when they secured the first overall selection of this year's NBA Draft.
The Mavs have already insinuated the pick is not available in a trade, and all signs point to them taking the Duke star.
It amounts to a bailout for Dallas, which traded away Luka Dončić during the season.
Because the Mavericks had only a 1.8% chance of getting the first pick, there has been speculation the lottery was rigged.

Either way, it's a huge boost for the Mavs, who are getting just the fourth player to win the Wooden Award as a freshman, joining Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis and Zion Williamson.
However, Stephen A. Smith said Flagg's skill wasn't the only reason to select him.
""When you’ve got somebody with that kind of potential, and they’re White and you are in America, you keep that dude. I’m telling you right now,"" Smith said on Wednesday's edition of ""First Take.""
Smith backtracked a tad, noting the Mavs shouldn't pick Flagg strictly because he is White.

""The first order of business is he can ball,"" Smith added. ""It’s because he can play, but the fact that he’s White, marketable — even his name makes him more marketable. I’m not passing that up at all.""
Smith's comments echo some made about Caitlin Clark last year, notably WNBA MVP A'ja Wilson.
""I think it’s a huge thing. I think a lot of people may say it’s not about Black and White, but, to me, it is,"" Wilson said at the time. ""It really is because you can be top-notch at what you are as a Black woman, but yet maybe that’s something that people don’t want to see.
""They don’t see it as marketable, so it doesn’t matter how hard I work. It doesn’t matter what we all do as Black women, we’re still going to be swept underneath the rug. That’s why it boils my blood when people say it’s not about race, because it is.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-should-adopt-draft-lottery-arch-manning-becomes-eligible-schefter-argues","ESPN insider suggests massive NFL Draft change before Arch Manning becomes eligible","Texas Longhorns head coach Steve Sarkisian joins Colin Cowherd to break down Arch Manning’s development and expectations for the season.
Arch Manning’s junior season at Texas will be under a heavy spotlight this upcoming college football season, and many believe he's the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy and become the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.
It’s not a certainty Manning will decide to go pro next year, but he does have the option to do so being three years removed from high school.
If he does, ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter says the league should borrow from the NBA and host a draft lottery.

The NBA’s draft lottery is designed so teams can't tank a season for the first overall selection in the following year’s draft. Though there was debate Monday about the Dallas Mavericks being awarded the first pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, they had just a 1.8% chance of getting the pick.
Granted, NBA teams still try to lose to increase their percentage of winning the first pick in the lottery. But the process still works, and Schefter agrees with the NBA’s decision not to incentivize losing altogether.
ARCH MANNING HYPE BEGINS AS EARLY MOCK DRAFTS GET RELEASED BEFORE 2025 SEASON
""The more I think about it, the more I think the NFL should be in that business,"" Schefter said on ESPN Radio’s ""Unsportsmanlike."" ""They don’t want teams to tank. They don’t want teams to lose. We had a couple situations last year where, in the last game of the year, the [New England] Patriots are putting in Joe Milton. I’m not telling you they’re trying to lose, but they certainly don’t want to win.""

Milton did lead the Patriots over the Bills in Week 18, 23-16, but Buffalo sat most of its starters for the playoffs.
Still, Schefter’s idea is one that might catch on.
""If nothing else, if the NFL were able to implement a lottery system, they’d have one more night of ratings,"" Schefter said. ""They’re doing shows for everything else. Why would there not be a draft lottery show? That would rate huge. Could you imagine a year where there is a top quarterback prospect or the year Arch Manning comes out? They put that in primetime, a half-hour special primetime NFL Draft Lottery. Come on, it's a home run.""

With Quinn Ewers drafted by the Miami Dolphins, Manning is the presumptive starter for the Longhorns for the 2025-26 college season. He has flashed his talent in games Ewers was hurt or Texas was up big, but he’s never had to lead the team through a full season.
Manning hasn’t hinted one way or another regarding his draft status for 2026..

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Draymond Green has found a new way to get on the NBA's bad side.
The Golden State Warriors star was fined $50,000 Wednesday for making an ""inappropriate comment"" to the officials during Game 3 of a second-round playoff series against Minnesota.
The NBA said Green questioned ""the integrity of game officials"" in the Warriors' 102-97 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Green appeared to reference the game's point spread to the refs during the game.
""Five-and-a-half. I know what they're doing,"" Green appeared to say. Minnesota was -5.5 and covered.
Green has been assessed a league-high five technical fouls this postseason and would have to serve a one-game suspension if the total reaches seven. He has also been called for two flagrant fouls.
He was suspended for Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals for accumulating too many flagrant fouls that postseason and was suspended for one game in the 2023 playoffs for stepping on the chest of Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis.
According to the website Spotrac, Green has been fined $992,000 in his career, with $185,000 coming for actions toward officials. He also has been docked $3.2 million for suspensions.
Green was suspended indefinitely last season for his on-court antics from prior playoff games, including stomping on Sabonis. He also put Rudy Gobert in a chokehold and hit Jusuf Nurkić with an open hand, which led to the extended suspension.

Green recently went on a tangent about how he has an ""agenda"" as an ""angry Black man.""
Green recently admitted he was ""embarrassed"" he ""pouted way too much"" during a game at home in which the Warriors lost, forcing a Game 7 in the first round of the playoffs. He said he had ""some heart-to-hearts"" with ""people I trust the most"" after that game.
""It's just a habit he has when somebody fouls him, and he's smart,"" head coach Steve Kerr said at the time. ""So, I think it was Reid reached, and, on the reach, Draymond kind of swiped through and drew the foul. But he does have a habit of sort of flailing his arm to try to make sure the ref sees it, and he made contact. And that's what led to the tech.
""It's part of Draymond,"" Kerr added. ""It's the same thing that makes him such a competitor and a winner, puts him over the top sometimes, and we know that. And it's our job to try to help him stay poised, stay composed. But the competition is so meaningful to him that occasionally he goes over the line.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/marcus-ericsson-wants-feel-indy-500-euphoria-again-knows-how-difficult","Marcus Ericsson knows winning Indy 500 again won’t be easy, but he has a secret ingredient","International driving superstar Katherine Legge previews her fourth Indianapolis 500 says it's the 'most fun you can have' on 'Fox News Saturday Night with Jimmy Failla.'
On May 29, 2022, Marcus Ericsson was on top of the IndyCar world, having just driven 500 miles faster than anyone else on the planet.
At 31 years old, Ericsson earned his first Indy 500 victory. Not long before, he had been having trouble finding his footing in Formula One.
Ericsson joined F1 in 2014 and lasted for five seasons, but he never won a race. In fact, his best finish was an eighth-place run in 2015, and he had just 11 top-10s in his five-year stint there.
But today, he's in IndyCar lore.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

""The problem in F1 is it’s about being in the right car and right team to win. In F1, the same guys win. In F1, all the guys build their own car. So if you’re a big team with a lot of resources, it’s easy to build a very good car. If you’re a small team with less resources, it’s more difficult,"" Ericsson told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. ""So over five years, I was on smaller teams and never got a chance to show what I could do. So IndyCar came up as an option, everyone has the same option, and you can set it up for you as a driver. Waking up on race day knowing I had a chance to win was something I really missed in Formula One.""
Of course, no matter what circuit Ericsson is running, winning is difficult. There aren't milk, beer and champagne showers in victory lane for no reason. For Ericsson and racers alike, it's a mental game, knowing that you will lose much more often than you win.
""It is very tough, and it's one of the biggest challenges with racing. I would say it’s that mental side of things and always sort of believing in yourself, pushing yourself forward and staying tough and sort of staying confident,"" Ericsson said. ""That’s a constant challenge that we all go through. Racing, golf, even if you win a lot, you win rarely. It’s a special thing, it takes a lot of mental toughness to perform at a high level every weekend and go through that season after season.""

""In the past, I was very results-driven, I want to have this many wins and this many podiums in a year,"" he added. ""But I’ve learned in my career that that’s not a great way of focusing. Sometimes, there are things outside of your control that’s happening. In racing, there are so many things that can go wrong. So I try to focus on my own performance. I want to have as many weekends where I felt like I performed at my best. And due to other circumstances, your best may only be a fifth-place finish, but that was your maximum that day. That’s something I’ve learned throughout my career. And be honest with yourself – did I get the most out of myself today?""
INDYCAR POWER RANKINGS: WILL THE INDY 500 JUMBLE THIS LIST?
One way Ericsson does get the most out of himself, though, is by taking Allegra, a brand which he will be representing at this year's Indy 500. It's a partnership that is perfect timing given allergy season, but it also makes a world of a difference on the track.
""Zero percent brain interference, staying sharp, non-drowsiness, those are the keys to not only in the race car but a day in the life. And to represent them at the Indy 500 is really cool,"" Ericcson said. ""It’s perfect timing. Everyone on my crew is using it to stay sharp, because every split-second in racing matters.""
Ericsson knows that better than anybody – he led on the final lap of the Indy 500 in 2023 as well, but crossed the finish line second.

""When we’re racing 200-plus miles an hour, you need to be mentally there all the time. It’s so important for someone like me to be able to do that and not drift away. The mental side is always something I’ve focused on, because the higher you are in any sport, but racing in particular, the mental strength can make a difference between winning and losing,"" he added. ""People don’t realize how tough it is to drive our cars. He hit up to five Gs, and that focus to stay laser sharp for two or three hours is definitely challenging. You’re drained, body’s drained, mind’s drained, it’s really tough.""
The racing spectacle is now less than two weeks away, and Ericsson knows exactly what he has to do to bring home the victory again.

""The month of May is all about winning. This is our Super Bowl – winner takes all. I need to have a car that’s beneath me, take it step by step, patience is the name of the game,"" he said.
""It’s a long month before we get to race day. And hopefully the Allegra car will be in victory lane.""

The Celtics have squandered two 20-point leads and another lead of 14 points and trail their second-round playoff series 3-1 to the New York Knicks.
The Celtics also lost Jayson Tatum to a torn Achilles in the closing minutes of Game 4.

It's a grim outlook for Boston, but Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who predicted the series was over after Boston won Game 3, is hoping to use his Celtics fandom powers for good.
Portnoy said he ran into a Knicks star in a Boston hotel prior to Game 5 and gave him a message.
""I saw Mikal Bridges in the hotel this morning. I gave him a subtle, ‘Hey, don’t break your wrist,'"" Portnoy said on his outlet.
Portnoy said it was a ""joke.""
""He was kind of like a Barstool guy. He tapped me, and I’m like, ‘All right.’ And he’s like, ‘Hey, good to see you,'"" Portnoy added.

Bridges is one of several ""Nova Knicks"" who also include Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart. Villanova alumnus Donte DiVincenzo was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, along with Julius Randle, for Karl-Anthony Towns in the offseason. Brunson, Hart, DiVincenzo and Bridges all won a national championship with the Wildcats.
New York came back from 20-point deficits in both Games 1 and 2, which were played in Boston, and Bridges played pivotal roles in both games. He got the game-winning steal in Game 1 and blocked a potential buzzer-beater in Game 2.
But Boston would not relinquish such a lead in Game 3, which led many to wonder if the Knicks' runs were a fluke.
In Game 4, the Knicks trailed by double-digits again in the second half, and it didn't phase them at all. They ended the third quarter on a 30-13 run to take a three-point lead, and another 18-5 run late in the fourth completed the comeback after Tatum was injured.

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/belichicks-girlfriend-hudson-reveals-identity-erasure-letter-cheerleading-team","Bill Belichick's girlfriend Jordon Hudson says relationship led to 'identity erasure' in letter to cheer team","The ‘Fox News Saturday Night’ panel evaluates the latest developments in legendary football coach Bill Belichick’s dating saga.
Bill Belichick's controversial 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson said she experienced an identity ""erasure"" in a recent letter to her cheerleading teammates, according to The Washington Post.
A letter obtained by the outlet showed Hudson apologizing to the members of her adult cheerleading team BlackOut, and thanking them for ""tolerating… baggage"" related to her romance.
""During this time I have faced a slow, exterior erasure of my strong, individual identity. I can’t thank you [enough] for helping keep that in tact by embracing me, for me. It is so difficult for me to give up my time with you, because I feel like I am giving up a part of myself in the process,"" read the letter, which was dated Dec. 14, 2024.
""I want to take a moment to both apologize for, and simultaneously thank you for all of the ‘baggage’ that comes with having me around; from the interlopers at practice, to the subsequent media exploitation, to the lack of dependability.""
The letter ultimately stated her decision to leave, insisting it was the best decision for the team.

The Maine native has become one of the most notorious figures in football in recent weeks. Her romantic relationship, and now business relationship, with Belichick has prompted multiple controversies and concerns about the coach's current mindset and reputation.
With Belichick set to lead UNC's football program in 2025, Hudson has been a visible and involved presence in the program's operations.
Since the university hired Belichick in December, Hudson has served in an unofficial role on the football program, which includes being copied on all emails sent to Belichick, per multiple reports.
Meanwhile, a report by The Athletic suggests Hudson also played a role in preventing UNC from being featured in an offseason special of HBO's popular ""Hard Knocks"" series.
CHARLES BARKLEY EXPRESSES CONCERN ABOUT HOW JORDON HUDSON IS AFFECTING BILL BELICHICK'S LEGACY
""Jordon Hudson, Belichick’s girlfriend, played an instrumental role in stopping the production, related to her request to be heavily involved in the project, according to multiple industry sources briefed on the negotiations,"" the report read.
Hudson recently exclaimed a now-infamous line during Belichick's ""CBS News Sunday Morning"" interview. When interviewer Tony Dokoupil asked Belichick how he and Hudson met, she interjected, ""We’re not talking about this.""
Belichick later released a statement through UNC addressing the incident, accusing CBS of trying to create a ""false narrative."" The coach said he ""clearly communicated"" to his publicist, Simon & Schuster, that any promotional interviews would be ""solely"" on his upcoming book, ""The Art of Winning – Lessons from My Life in Football,"" but the network didn't honor that request.
""I was surprised when unrelated topics were introduced and I repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Dokoupil, and the producers that I preferred to keep the conversation centered on the book,"" the statement read.
""After [this] occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion. She was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track.""
CBS responded with its own statement.
""When we agreed to speak with Mr. Belichick, it was for a wide-ranging interview,"" a CBS News spokesperson said in a statement on X. ""There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation. This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.""

Hudson was caught up in another disputed report related to UNC on Friday. Independent journalist Pablo Torre reported that she was barred from North Carolina’s athletics facilities and football field.
However, the university disputed Torre's report.
""While Jordon Hudson is not an employee at the University or Carolina Athletics, she is welcome to the Carolina Football facilities. Jordon will continue to manage all activities related to Coach Belichick’s personal brand outside of his responsibilities for Carolina Football and the University,"" the school said.

Caitlin Clark and Taylor Swift made national headlines as they took in a Kansas City Chiefs playoff game together in a suite at Arrowhead Stadium this past NFL season.
WNBA phenom Clark, a huge fan of Swift’s musical talents prior to meeting her, pulled back the curtain recently on what the two discussed. And while they are mega-stars in each of their own professions, just like any other fan in the stands, they were having ""normal conversations.""
""I think what people don’t always realize about people with a certain spotlight, whether it’s her, whether it’s me, whether it’s another professional athlete or a pop star, we’re real people,"" Clark told ESPN in a feature.

Clark, who grew up a Chiefs fan, learned all about Swift’s love for the team and the game.
""She loves the Chiefs just as much as I do,"" she revealed. ""I’m talking football with her. She loved it, and just like her passion, and honestly, probably one of the sweetest people I’ve ever been around. And everybody says that when you meet her, but it’s really true. She just treats everybody with the same amount of kindness, and her family was great.""
WNBA STAR CAITLIN CLARK DETAILS 'INCREDIBLE' EXPERIENCE ALONGSIDE TAYLOR SWIFT AT CHIEFS' PLAYOFF GAME
Clark and Swift watched as the Chiefs took down the Houston Texans in the divisional round to move on in the playoffs. Travis Kelce, the Chiefs' star tight end and Swift’s boyfriend, scored a touchdown in the 23-14 victory over the Texans.
The Chiefs ultimately reached the Super Bowl for the third year in a row, but, unfortunately for them, NFL history was unable to be made as the Philadelphia Eagles prevailed in Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, 40-22, denying Kansas City the chance to become the first team ever to win three Lombardi Trophies in a row.

Swift was also at that game in Caesars Superdome on Feb. 9.
While Swift and Kelce are enjoying some time together in the NFL offseason, Clark is preparing for her second WNBA season with the Indiana Fever, which is set to kick off on Saturday.
Clark, who broke WNBA records on her way to being named the Rookie of the Year, and her squad will face off against Angel Reese and the Chicago Sky at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Clark and Reese made waves in their rookie seasons, extending their rivalry from college while battling for a national title with Iowa and LSU, respectively.

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trumps-influence-possible-factor-mlbs-removal-pete-rose-from-ineligible-list-espn-broadcaster-says","Trump's influence possible factor in MLB's removal of Pete Rose from ineligible list, ESPN broadcaster says","Trump's influence a possible factor in MLB's removal of Pete Rose from permanently ineligible list, ESPN broadcaster Karl Ravech says during an appearance on OutKick's ""The Ricky Cobb Show.""
Pete Rose was removed from Major League Baseball’s permanently ineligible list on Tuesday.
MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred wrote that upon a player’s death, they are no longer ineligible as they can no longer ""represent a threat to the integrity of the game,"" in a letter obtained by ESPN. Seventeen players are now eligible to be voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
ESPN’s ""Sunday Night Baseball"" broadcaster Karl Ravech thought Rose’s reinstatement seems associated with Manfred’s recent meeting with President Donald Trump.

Trump and Manfred met at the White House last month, but it is unclear what the two discussed. Trump has been ardent in his belief that Pete Rose should be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
""It seems more closely associated with a meeting he had with the president, Donald Trump, who made it quite clear he wanted to absolve Pete Rose and get him back into a position where he would then be eligible for a committee to get him into the Hall of Fame,"" Ravech said during an appearance on OutKick’s ""The Ricky Cobb Show.""
Trump posted to Truth Social in February that he would posthumously pardon Rose. MLB’s hit king served five months in prison in 1990 and in 2017 was accused of statutory rape from an encounter decades earlier.
Ravech said he himself is unsure of MLB’s motivation for removing Rose from the ineligible list.
""To me, I’m not sure what that motivation is. To me, permanently ineligible means just that. The passing of Pete Rose doesn’t necessarily change the dynamic for me; he was permanently ineligible. I look at the Hall of Fame, and this is such an individual, personal conversation and your feelings about Rose and your feelings about the sport,"" Ravech said.
ESPN'S TONY KORNHEISER EXPLAINS WHY PETE ROSE'S REINSTATEMENT DOESN'T GUARANTEE HALL OF FAME
Cincinnati Reds player Pete Rose in 1985. (IMAGN)
""For me, Pete Rose is in the Hall of Fame. If you go to Cooperstown, you will see the numbers, you’ll see the bats, you’ll hear about the records, you know that nobody in the history of the game has more hits than Pete Rose. If you are talking about putting a plaque up in the hall where all the other plaques are, that’s a different story and that’s clearly what this paves the way for.""
Ravech does not believe, however, that Rose’s removal from the permanently ineligible list means he is guaranteed to be voted into the Hall of Fame.
""Doesn’t mean Rick, that this is now going to greenlight him to get him in. It’s quite clear the players who are on these committees have made it clear any stain on the game, whether it’d be steroids, those guys got like four votes in the most recent committee,"" Ravech said.
""Gambling is another one, having grown up in clubhouses the last 30 years, [I] remember walking into every one of them and the top line is in essence the commandment: Thou shall not bet on baseball. He violated it, he was then put on a permanently ineligible list.""

Rose died at age 83 in September 2024, but the debate about whether he should be in the Hall of Fame has raged on.
Rose is MLB’s hit king with 4,256 career hits. He was the National League MVP in 1974 and was a 17-time All-Star, a three-time World Series champion and a three-time batting champion.
However, the Cincinnati Reds star became a polarizing figure when news of his gambling on games rocked the sports world. Rose received a lifetime ban from MLB in 1989, but after Tuesday’s announcement, will be eligible to be voted on for the first time.

A legal firm and an activist group are pressuring the Indiana High School Athletics Association (IHSAA) board of directors, urging it to get rid of two DEI quotas for board members.
The current criteria for the board's members includes a requirement for two female members and two members who are racial minorities.
""The Board of Directors shall be comprised of nineteen board seats. Twelve board seats shall be filled by any qualified individual (open seats), and seven board seats shall be filled by Two (2) qualified female representatives, Two (2) qualified minorities,"" the policy states.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM
Now, the law firm, Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), and the activist group, Equal Protection Project (EPP), have sent a letter to the IHSAA board of directors, objecting to this criteria and demanding change.
""No one should be denied the opportunity to serve on a public board due to their race or sex. Our Constitution and civil rights law demand that individuals be judged on their character, qualifications, and achievements, not on characteristics they cannot control. IHSAA has a constitutional duty to treat all Board of Director nominees equally under the law,"" part of the letter reads.
""Race- and sex-based quotas like those used by IHSAA perpetuate stereotypes, patronize the qualified, and undermine the ability of other qualified citizens to serve their communities. We strongly urge this Board to reconsider its use of these unconstitutional quotas.""
Pacific Legal Foundation attorney Laura D’Agostino condemned the IHSAA's criteria.
""Public boards should reflect the talents and commitment of all citizens, not arbitrary categories of race or sex. Every individual who wants to step up and serve their community should be encouraged to do so based on what they bring to the table, not held back because of who they are,"" D'Agostino told Fox News Digital.
PLF and EPP ended the letter by providing a deadline of May 30 for the IHSAA to respond with an agreement to remove those two requirements for its board of directors.
TRUMP TO PRESIDE OVER HISTORIC SPORTING EVENTS — WHICH TEAMS AND STARS COULD SKIP WHITE HOUSE VISITS?
EPP founder William A. Jacobson suggested further legal steps could be taken if the deadline passes with no agreement.
""We hope that IHSAA will do the right thing and voluntarily remedy the discriminatory bylaws provisions, but if it does not, all legal options are on the table,"" Jacobson told Fox News Digital.
Fox News Digital has reached out to the IHSAA for comment.
Recent executive orders by President Donald Trump have targeted DEI in both public institutions and the private sector, and many states have passed their own laws to prohibit DEI quotas in taxpayer-funded organizations.
Trump's day one executive order, which the GSA is aligning its actions with, directed the federal contracting process to ""be streamlined to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil-rights laws.""
The order also commanded the Office of Federal Contract Compliance to ""immediately cease"" promoting ""diversity"" and any encouragement of federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in affirmative action-like efforts that consider race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion or national origin when making hiring decisions.

Meanwhile, in Indiana, a state bill authored by Republican Sens. Tyler Johnson and Gary Byrne to outlaw ""discrimination"" in state education, public employment and licensing settings that is ""based on a personal characteristic of the person,"" was signed by Gov. Mike Braun on May 1.
Braun signed an executive order in January to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion in all state agencies and replace it with what he calls ""MEI"" – merit, excellence and innovation.
Under that executive order, government offices cannot use state funds, property or resources to support DEI initiatives or require job candidates to issue DEI statements.

Nick Wright disputes the claim that the lottery is rigged.
The cries of a rigged NBA Draft Lottery are loud and clear once again.
The Dallas Mavericks, with a 1.8% chance of earning the top pick months after trading away star Luka Doncic, came away with the right to draft Duke's Cooper Flagg.
This, of course, is not the first time there have been suspicions: There's the frozen envelope theory from 1985 for the New York Knicks to get Patrick Ewing; the Cleveland Cavaliers got the No. 1 pick when the top prospect was a local kid named LeBron James (same with the Chicago Bulls and Derrick Rose in 2008); and many believe the San Antonio Spurs were gifted Victor Wembanyama in 2023.

Well, Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade didn't exactly shut down any ongoing speculation.
""It's a business,"" he said in a recent interview.
Wade, of course, would not go out and say it is for sure rigged, ""because I'm not a witness in it.""
""But this is a business that we are a part of. And I think people forget that in the competition of sports and what we love, because we grow up playing sports, and it's not a business when we grow up. But when you're in the NBA, it's a business. And the business has to do its best job to make sure that, you know, it's taken care of,"" he said.

Tim Tebow had a lot of great moments in his football career, but two of his biggest ones came on the same date three years apart: Jan. 8.
On Jan. 8, 2009, Tebow led Florida to a 24-14 national championship victory over Oklahoma, the team’s second championship in three seasons.
On Jan. 8, 2012, Tebow’s Denver Broncos beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 29-23 in the AFC wild-card round in an overtime thriller. On the first play of overtime, Tebow connected with wide receiver Demaryius Thomas for an 80-yard touchdown to win the game.

Beyond the date holding significance to Tebow, what transpired in those football games reaffirmed Tebow’s faith in God.
During Florida’s national championship victory in 2009, Tebow wrote ""John 3:16"" on his eye black that he wore that game.
After the Broncos' thrilling comeback over the Steelers three years later, a Broncos PR person made Tebow aware of some statistics that were linked to that Bible verse.
""Right before I walk in this big room packed full of media (after the game), there's all these curtains out front, and I'm standing in front. Patrick, our PR guy (with the Broncos), stepped in front of me and said, ‘Timmy, do you realize what happened?’ and I'm like, ‘Yeah we just beat the Steelers we're going to play the Patriots.’ Like yeah, I know what happened dude, like why (did) you ask me such a silly question, and he goes, ‘No, do you know what happened?’"" Tebow said during a recent appearance on the ""Shawn Ryan Show.""
""And I'm like, ‘I thought I did, Patrick, what happened?’ Because you could just see this different demeanor. He said, ‘Timmy, no, you don't know what happened, Timmy, It's exactly three years from the night that you wore John 3:16 under your eyes.’ And I'm like, ‘Oh wow, that's awesome, that's so cool.’ And he said ‘No, no, no you don't realize it. Timmy, during the game you threw for 316 yards.’ And I'm like ‘What?’""

""And he said, ‘Timmy, during the game your yards per rush were 3.16. Your yards per completion were 31.6. The ratings for the night were 31.6 and the time of possession was 31:06. During the night, over 90 million people have googled John 3:16 It's the number one trending thing all over.""
Tebow was taken aback as he realized that God had sent him a message.
""I don't think I had the reaction that a lot of people think I did, because I went from a high and a celebration and a joy to a conviction and a disappointment. Why? Because when (Patrick) was telling me that I knew that God was convicting me, saying, ‘Timmy, you thought tonight was about a game. You thought it was about all of these things. It's never just about a game. I didn't die for a game,’"" Tebow said.
""And I was so convicted, still grateful that God would use something, but convicted man, my eyes were on the wrong thing, my heart was in the wrong place. I knew You, I knew what You'd done, but still my heart was here, and my eyes were here. I knew the truth, I just wasn't focused on it. I was having all of these selfish ambitions and goals.""
Tebow explained that he wanted to win the game to prove the doubters wrong, and he wanted to win it for the fans and his family who supported him. However, the quarterback said, those were ""selfish"" reasons, and that his ""eyes"" and ""heart"" were looking at the wrong things.

Those ""selfish"" ambitions took him away from where God needed him to be, and the former Broncos quarterback said verse John 3:16 is the ""greatest love story"" of all time.
""That verse means to me, it's if you're going to sum up the love of the Gospel, which I really believe, when we talk about the Gospel, that it is the greatest love story rescue mission of all time. That there is a God that loves us so much that he sent his son to put on flesh to live a life we couldn't live but choose to die a death that we deserve to die as a ransom for us as the propitiation meaning the payment that satisfies and that payment was his life,"" Tebow said.
""When we look at John 3:16 for God so loved the world he gave because he loved us so much with this love that, honestly, it's hard to even fathom. But when we talk about that love in Greek, they have four types of love, but the most admirable form of love that love, is agape love. And the best definition of agape love is to choose the best interests of another person and act on their behalf and Jesus chose our best interest.""
""And he acted on our behalf, and he went to the cross not just for us, but instead of us. And he loved us so much that he gave his one and only son that whosoever would believe in him would not perish but have everlasting life. Man, I know we put it on bumper stickers and eye blacks and signs and games and everything, but we can't lose the essence in the heart of what that means.""

""That there's a God that created all of this and spoke it into existence like this, and yet that God with all knowledge and all power would say ‘I love you so much that I'm going to give what's so precious for me and my son and I'm going to give him in exchange for you because I love you that much.’ So, when you think about John 3:16 it's um there's no greater love.""
Tebow played three seasons in the NFL, two with the Broncos and one with the New York Jets.
The former quarterback is soon to have a new title: dad. Tebow and his wife, Demi-Leigh, announced they are expecting their first child, a baby girl, in March.

Female athletes sent fiery messages to Nike amid the push for fairness in women’s sports and the elimination of biological males competing against them in different levels of competition.
An XX-XY Athletics advertisement asked several athletes that if they could send a message to Nike, what would it be? Riley Gaines, Macey Boggs, Lauren Miller and Payton McNabb were among those featured in the video.

""If I had a chance to talk to Nike, I would tell them to just do it,"" Gaines, the former Kentucky Wildcats star swimmer and OutKick contributor, said in the clip. ""That’s your slogan, isn’t it, Nike? Just do it. When I say it, I mean the right thing. And that’s defending women and biological reality.""
Miller, a pro golfer who participated in the 2022 U.S. Women’s Open, asked the company to ""think about your daughters.""
""If we let men and boys continue to invade, women’s sports will be erased,"" he said.
McNabb, who was left with brain damage after being hit in the face by a spike from a biological male during a high school volleyball match, said she had ""dreams of playing"" the sport in college, but the incident dashed them.

""You’re saying that you’re supporting women, but you’re not actually doing anything,"" Boggs, a high school volleyball player, said. ""You are using us when it’s convenient, but in private, you’re not doing anything about it.""
Former NCAA swimmer Kaitlynn Wheeler, Canadian weightlifter April Hutchinson, former Nevada Wolf Pack volleyball player Sia Liilii and former San Jose State assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose also spoke out.
Nike did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.
The company has been under fire over the last few weeks over allegations that it funded a study to research transgender youths and the issue of males competing in girls’ and women’s sports. The first inkling of the study appeared in a New York Times article.

The Kansas City Chiefs were reportedly set to take on the Los Angeles Chargers in São Paulo in the first week of the season.
It is the second straight year the NFL will hold a game on the South American continent.
Travis Kelce essentially confirmed the Chiefs would be the Chargers’ opponent during an episode of his podcast, and he already expressed that he is not looking forward to it.

As he explained, he is bothered by the heat.
""Yeah, we’re definitely playing in Brazil,"" Kelce said with a smile on the ""New Heights"" podcast. ""I also heard those rumors. … I’ll be there, playing football, in the f---ing heat.""
Jason Kelce said he wanted to go and support the Philadelphia Eagles when they played against the Green Bay Packers last season. He said the field was ""atrocious.""
""The old field thing,"" Travis Kelce said mockingly in an apparent reference to the Eagles’ Super Bowl loss to the Chiefs, which resulted in complaints about the field in Arizona. ""’The guys are slipping all over the place.’ How about we play with our shoulders over our toes? The guys were not slipping in New Orleans … I was slipping.""

Kelce said he was not exactly excited about the game in Brazil.
""There’s just something about getting closer to the equator. I don’t want to put on a football uniform doing that. I’ve been in Jacksonville in September and that’s f---ing miserable,"" he said.
When told that São Paulo is more inland, Kelce said he would rather be ""dry than humid.""
""I will say this, if it’s humid, I’m gonna be miserable,"" he added. ""… If it’s hot and humid, and it’s kind a what I’m expecting, I’m going to be miserable but we’re going to find a way to get a win.""

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are weighing in on a potential presidential run and have warned the GOP not to underestimate the progressive lawmaker.
Stephen A. Smith had a question for ""Democrats everywhere"" on Tuesday during the latest episode of his podcast as he touched on the possibility of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., (AOC) running for president.
""What is your strategy?"" Smith asked.
The ESPN personality turned his attention to AOC and a Wall Street Journal report that said she was nOt ruling anything out, including possible Senate and presidential runs. The paper added that some Democrats worried Ocasio-Cortez would ""turn off the centrist voters they need to win competitive races.""

Smith agreed she would turn off centrists, saying her platform does nOt resonate with most American voters.
""I think if you are a Democrat, if you are a leftist who rails against the system, who believes free-market capitalism spearheaded by billionaires is not the way to go, if you believe that not enough attention is being paid to the desolate and disenfranchised, if you believe that higher taxes is the way to go, that a focus shouldn’t be on securing the borders, if you believe those kind of things, and that’s where you stand ideologically, AOC is your candidate,"" he said on ""The Stephen A. Smith Show."" ""No doubt about that.""
Smith said he had no doubts about her ability to fight for what she believes and fight for the district in New York that she represents. However, he wondered whether the strategy is something that could win elections.
""Most people in the country are centrists, they’re moderates. Whether they’re Republican moderates or Democratic moderates or just flat-out centrists who are independents – that’s most of the American population,"" he said. ""They are not MAGA right and they are not progressive left. She clearly is (progressive left). And not be literal and not to be taken literally, but she gives the impression, when you talk about universal healthcare and you talk about other things, if you equate it to taxing Americans 70% of their income she wouldn’t be against it. That ain’t going to win you elections. That’s not going to win you elections.

""If you’re living in this day and age, and you’re talking about fighting for certain rights as it pertains to transgender individuals, athletes transitioning and men competing in women’s sports and stuff like that, which she is not about to speak against. If you think that’s going to win you an election, you’ve got your head in the sand.""
He said he wanted to hear some kind of plan from the Democrats. He pointed to Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, who has seemed to be just against anything related to President Donald Trump.
Smith suggested he did not think that was doing enough to legislate.
""The real issue I’m having right now with the Democratic Party is I’m waiting to hear what your plan is,"" he said. ""It can’t be, ‘We’re just against all things Trump.’
""What’s your plan? What’s your plan for the economy? What’s your plan as it pertains to comprehensive immigration reform? What is your plan when it comes to foreign affairs? What is your plan as it pertains to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or should I say Israel with Hamas? What is your plan with Russia and Ukraine? Is it just giving Ukraine more money like Biden was willing to do? What are your plans? … What is the plan as it pertains to the vast majority of Americans in this country?""

National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) defender Savy King underwent heart surgery following her frightening collapse during a match for Angel City on Friday night, the team said.
King was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after she suffered a medical issue while playing against the Utah Royals. Doctors discovered an abnormality in her heart, and she underwent surgery on Tuesday.

""On behalf of our entire family, along with Savy, we have been so moved by the love and support from Angel City players, staff, fans and community, as well as soccer fans across the country,"" King’s family said in a statement. ""We are blessed to share Savy is recovering well and we are looking forward to having her home with us soon.""
Angel City said King was resting and that her ""prognosis is excellent.""
The incident occurred in the 74th minute of the match. Medical personnel attended to King for about 10 minutes before she was stretched off of the field and onto a cart.
The NWSL said it would review policies to see if changes need to be made when dealing with medical emergencies.

The rules stated that the league ""recognizes that emergencies may arise which make the start or progression of a Game inadvisable or dangerous for participants and spectators. Certain event categories automatically trigger the League Office into an evaluation of whether delay or postponement is necessary.""
Officials put 12 minutes of stoppage time on the clock and played through the end of the match. Angel City won 2-0.
Bay FC selected King with the No. 2 pick out of North Carolina in the 2024 NWSL Draft. She appeared in 18 matches for the club before she was traded to Angel City in the offseason.

Chicago Sky star Angel Reese was uninterested in answering a question about a bold statement she made when it came to growing the WNBA.
Reese made it clear last June that she believed it was not just ""one person"" who changed the game of women’s basketball and that historians will look back on the moment in 2024 and prove her right.

""It’s because of me too,"" Reese said.
On Tuesday, Reese was about to be asked whether she still felt like that when she interjected.
""Next question,"" she said, via FOX 32 Chicago.
A Sky official off to the side also chimed in to move on from the question.
The question of who made a bigger impact on the popularity of the WNBA will keep lingering. For what it is worth, the Indiana Fever have dozens of games on national TV this season – more than the defending champion New York Liberty.
Reese is entering her second season in the WNBA with all eyes on how she will fare in 2025 with a new head coach and a couple of new teammates around her.

ANGEL REESE'S MOM TAKES APPARENT SHOT AT CAITLIN CLARK'S FAN BASE: 'WE AIN'T THE SAME'
The former LSU star’s rookie campaign came to an abrupt end when she suffered an injury that kept her off the floor and prevented Chicago from a final push to the playoffs. She was an All-Star last season and averaged 13.6 points and 13.1 rebounds per game. She earned MVP votes and finished second behind Caitlin Clark for WNBA Rookie of the Year.
In the offseason, WNBA legend Lisa Leslie offered advice about her game in February and expanded on it in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
""Angel has the motor, she has the energy that you need to be an amazing player,"" Leslie said. ""She has a nose for a ball that's really uncanny and really tough to stop. She's a physical player who plays, she enjoys the contact so you really can't rattle her. And I think we have all of those pieces that makes for a really great player.
""I think Angel's ability to score is gonna continue to get better, scoring on the inside and finishing on the left side and right side. She's a lefty who shoots very well on the right side. She has an excellent work ethic, and she's gonna continue to get better.""

And it doesn’t mean that I’m devoid of the right to call him a flaming hypocrite when it’s called upon,"" Smith said on ""The Stephen A. Smith Show."" ""Do y’all know how many commercials Charles Barkley does a year? He’ll tell us two. Have you seen Charles Barkley in two commercials? Are you kidding me? Oh, by the way, the cat that you work with at least twice a week during the NBA season is Shaquille O’Neal.
""Can we count the amount of endorsements he has? How often he’s seen everywhere? What new product he’s pitching? Did you say that about him? No, you didn’t. But when it comes to me, I need to be ‘careful.’""

I was like, ‘Yo man, you are starting to be too much right now,’"" Barkley said.
""Like, you are going to be on CNN, you are going to be on ‘Fox & Friends,’ now you on ‘General Hospital,’ now you on ‘Law & Order,’ I’m like, ‘Yo man, knock it off. Stop being on every TV show’ because at some point people are going to get sick of you, and you are going to be like, ‘Yeah I probably did too much.’ But once you do too much, it’s too late and people don’t take you serious, and I think he’s got to be careful in that aspect.""
Barkley said he wants to be on TV less and less, because ""less is more.""
""My friends close to me give me a lot of credit, and I’m not blowing my own horn, I want to be on TV as less as possible, to be honest with you Dan. That’s why I only do a couple commercials a year. I don’t go on a bunch of shows, less is more, because the more you do, the less people take you serious. And I don’t feel the need to grab every dime, I don’t feel the need to grab every dime at my disposal,"" Barkley said.

Zelina Vega talks to Fox News Digital about the premium live event.
WWE SummerSlam will be a two-night event for the first time in its history when the premium live event takes place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, later this summer.
For Zelina Vega, it will be a homecoming of sorts.

The current women’s United States champion grew up two rivers to the east in Queens, New York, but got her legs underneath her as a wrestler in the Garden State, specifically in Union City.
""I was training at the Ace Arena in Jersey for a while,"" Vega shared with Fox News Digital in a recent interview. ""Me and A.J. Lee actually trained together in Jersey and it also kind of helped me prepared for the role, if I’m going to be honest, in ‘Fighting with My Family’ to play her. It was just getting to know her then and applying that now and seeing it where it all kind of went down.
""But yeah, I spent a lot of time in New Jersey training and just that whole New York/New Jersey feel, it was just where I was constantly when I was coming.""
Vega won the Women’s United States Championship in a match against Chelsea Green after WrestleMania 41. The title was added to the menu as another opportunity for the loaded women’s roster on ""SmackDown."" The ""Raw"" roster has the Women’s Intercontinental Championship.
Vega told Fox News Digital previously that she hoped WWE was going to add a midcard title to the fold, and now she holds the belt – the first singles championship of her career in the company.

""It feels amazing … When I was growing up, I just wanted to be a part of it,"" she said. ""And of course, I wanted to be champion. I made this huge thing in my mind when I was a kid, I was like, ‘I’m gonna be champion, this is gonna happen for me.’ I didn’t see a Plan B in my mind.
""Now, it’s like, not only did you make it, not only you’re champion, you’re also a part of history. First-ever Queen of the Ring, like I never thought that was gonna happen. So, it’s still shocking me but also that eight-year-old Thea that was like trying to get all of this sorted out in my mind. I didn’t see a Plan B, I was so stubborn. I was like, ‘No, this is happening.’ So, proving her right, it feels like the most amazing feeling.""
Vega, as confident as ever that she will be walking into SummerSlam as the champion, also had advice for the young girls who are looking up at her.
""It’s just, never give up on you because you will have so many nos, you will have so many people giving you reasons as to why you shouldn’t be champion, why you shouldn’t make it where you want to be,"" she explained to Fox News Digital. ""But as long as you don’t give up on you, no one’s going to stop you.
""You don’t take ‘no’ for an answer and you don’t give up on yourself. If I can do this and I can stand here as champion, it should be proven in so many people’s minds that your own determination is what’s going to get you where you need to be.""

One year ago at this time, Arrow McLaren's Pato O'Ward had a dream.
When he closed his eyes at night, O'Ward told Fox News Digital he would dream of crossing the finish line at the Indy 500 before the rest of his competition.
""I keep racing multiple Indy 500's in my head. It’s crazy,"" he said last May. ""You try and tone it down as much as you can, but this race…it’s unlike anything else.""

The dream looked like it was about to come true when ""The Greatest Spectacle in Racing"" saw O'Ward leading with one lap to go until Josef Newgarden came flying from behind and past the McLaren black and orange car to come away with the win.
Instead of celebrating victory at ""The Brickyard,"" O'Ward was slumped over his vehicle as his team tried to console him. For the second time in three years, O'Ward was runner-up.

""I mean, at that moment, it was a moment that a lot of emotions were kind of exploding out of a bottle, and they truly were uncontrollable,"" he told Fox News Digital recently before the big race on Memorial Day weekend. ""It was a very raw scene of what it’s like to be just right there, but just missing it. It’s been a few times that that’s happened, so that’s why I think it was such a heavy emotion.
""I dedicate and do everything for this moment, and sometimes it’s just right there, but haven’t quite gotten it. It’s just the human side of it, I would say.""
Despite the results of the last few years in Indianapolis, O'Ward's optimistic outlook on his profession has not wavered entering this year's race.
""I mean, this time last year, I had like three [did not finish] by this point,"" he said while laughing.
""It’s one of the only months all year when you really get to enjoy the present, and you’re not focused on the future, you’re not focused on the past. You’re just focused on where you’re at. It’s a very amazing experience.""

The sting of defeat is something that almost never leaves the mind, even one full year after it happens. However, with every failure, an opportunity to learn comes, and that is exactly what O'Ward is getting from last year's finish.
""You gotta be up at the front the last stint,"" he said when asked what he learned from last year's runner-up finish. ""The last stint is super important, but also a race that can turn around one lap to another just because of a yellow flag falling. There’s a lot of different strategies going on, and it’s a race that constantly wants you to be flexible, agile. You need to adjust sails, rather than go against it.""
In five starts this season, O'Ward is still searching for his first victory, though he has two top-five and three top-10 finishes. As a result, he is currently ranked fourth in NTT IndyCar Series standings.
Perhaps his best race of the year came at the 2025 Grand Prix of Indianapolis this past weekend, finishing runner-up behind Alex Palou.
While O'Ward is not currently dreaming again about celebrating with his Arrow McLaren team, kissing the famed Yard of Bricks, and chugging some milk, as is custom for the champion, it is in the back of his mind somewhere.
That moment is what continues to drive him, especially knowing how close he was to realizing that dream.

""I think at this point, it’s a combination of a lot of different things, but it hasn’t been a reason like, ‘Hey, we’ve been lucky to have these opportunities.’ No, we’ve put ourselves in these opportunities, and we have earned ourselves the position to have these opportunities,"" he said. ""I think that alone just gives me a peace of mind along with my core team. We know how to do this, we know how to put ourselves in positions to win this race.
""I think, deep down, it gives us a lot of self-confidence of we’re not searching for something that we’ve never been in or we’re not searching for something that haven’t done.""
The Indy 500 will be broadcast May 25 on FOX with pre-coverage starting at 10 a.m. ET. It will also be available to stream live on FOXSports.com and the FOX Sports app.

Baseball fans are already calling for Pete Rose to enter the Hall of Fame after MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred announced he, alongside 16 deceased others, including ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson, were taken off the permanently ineligible list on Tuesday.
However, Manfred is not the one that would be placing Rose in the hallowed halls of Cooperstown, as ESPN’s Tony Kornheiser reminded all those fans on Tuesday.
""Rob Manfred does not put you in the Hall of Fame. The baseball writers, who are members, put you in the Hall of Fame,"" Kornheiser said on ""Pardon the Interruption.""
""Those baseball writers, as we know well, are guardians of the game. They take violations very seriously. Joe Jackson fixed games, OK? Pete Rose bet on games as a manager of one team. That doesn’t go away.""

Fans rushed to social media to voice their displeasure that MLB had waited until now to take Rose off its permanently ineligible list. With that, many felt the Hall of Fame was the right next step to rectify Rose’s absence from the game since the early 1990s.
Kornheiser, though, brought up another class of baseball players that baseball writers have not voted into the Hall yet.
""You know who else is eligible for the Hall of Fame right now? Barry Bonds is eligible, Mark McGwire is eligible,"" he said. ""Sammy Sosa, Roger Clemens, they’re eligible. Are they getting in any time soon? Doesn’t look that way from the voting.""
PETE ROSE'S REINSTATEMENT HAS BASEBALL FANS IN UPROAR: ‘WHAT A SHAME THEY WAITED UNTIL NOW’
Now, this is not to say Kornheiser does not want to see Rose in the Hall one day.
""As you know, Mike (Wilbon), I would put Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame,"" he added. ""I would put his sins on the plaque and his accomplishments on the plaque. I agree that, when your life is gone, it’s OK to be eligible for something. But I do not see Pete Rose as a first-ballot Hall of Famer. I just don’t.""
Rose, the MLB’s all-time hits leader, was added to the permanently ineligible list after it was found he gambled on games while as a player and manager. Rose initially denied the accusations, but in 2004, he came clean and admitted to gambling.

Manfred announced that the players’ ineligibility from the game ends upon their deaths.
""Obviously, a person no longer with us cannot represent a threat to the integrity of the game,"" Manfred wrote in a letter, obtained by ESPN, to attorney Jeffrey M. Lenkov.
""Moreover, it is hard to conceive of a penalty that has more deterrent effect than one that lasts a lifetime with no reprieve. Therefore, I have concluded that permanent ineligibility ends upon the passing of the disciplined individual, and Mr. Rose will be removed from the permanently ineligible list.""
President Donald Trump announced in March he would pardon Rose, who served five months in prison in 1990. In 2017, Rose was accused of statutory rape from an encounter decades earlier.

""Major League Baseball didn’t have the courage or decency to put the late, great, Pete Rose, also known as ‘Charlie Hustle,’ into the Baseball Hall of fame. Now he is dead, will never experience the thrill of being selected, even though he was a FAR BETTER PLAYER than most of those who made it, and can only be named posthumously. WHAT A SHAME!"" Trump posted.
Rose may be eligible for the Hall of Fame now, but it will be up to the baseball writers to vote him in to make it official.

Green Bay Packers great Clay Matthews pulled a hilarious stunt at the NFL Draft in Green Bay last month.
Matthews, 38, was on stage to kick off the draft with other former Packers’ stars and superfan Lil’ Wayne. He stepped up the microphone and said he had a ""message"" to deliver from President Donald Trump.

(Tork Mason/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)
""I just got off the phone with the president, Donald Trump. He asked me to pass a message along to all 32 NFL franchises. Let me tell you what it reads here, alright?"" Matthews began.
""It says, ‘My fellow Americans, the Bears still suck!’""
Matthews' stunt sent the Green Bay crowd and social media into a frenzy. The idea for the stunt began when he first found out he was going to be on stage.
""I looked at last year's (NFL Draft in Detroit) and it was Calvin Johnson, Barry Sanders, Aiden Hutchinson, Jared Goff, and I thought it was great. You got a mixture of legends and current players and but they all went up there, and they just screamed into the mic. I was just like I don't really just want to get up there and be like Green Bay make some noise so I was like let's make this memorable."" Matthews said during a recent appearance on ""Bussin’ With the Boys.""
The former Packers star certainly made it memorable. Matthews received his wife’s blessing to go ahead with the plan, and then she provided some assistance as she photoshopped Trump’s letterhead onto the paper.

Matthews did not tell the NFL what he was going to do, because he did not think the league would approve it.
""I didn't tell anybody because I knew the NFL wasn't going to approve it. I knew in today's political climate you mentioned one political affiliation, left, right, like it's just not going to go over well with the NFL,"" Matthews said.
As Matthews waited for his moment backstage, the nerves set in as no one knew what was about to happen. However, it went smoothly.
""Execution, delivery, everything was on point. I was happy with how it landed the boys all behind me they enjoyed it they had no idea, so they were you know equally as fired up you know anytime you can take a chance to put the Bears down you got to take it,"" Matthews said.
While it went smoothly onstage, Matthews was worried about the potential repercussions from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell backstage.

However, the former Packers’ great said Goodell was ""super cool"" about it, and they asked to take a picture of the letter to put on social media.
While it went well, Matthews said he would probably never be invited back for the epic stunt.

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/pete-roses-last-interviewer-reacts-his-hall-fame-eligibility-praises-trump-kickstarting-movement","Pete Rose's last interviewer reacts to his Hall of Fame eligibility, praises Trump for kickstarting movement","Former sportscaster John Condit joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to share clips from his interview with Rose days before his death as President Donald Trump plans to posthumously pardon the baseball all-star.
John Condit was the last person to interview Pete Rose, doing so 10 days before his death for a documentary to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Rose breaking Ty Cobb's hit record.
In that interview, the Major League Baseball (MLB) all-time hit king predicted that if he were to ever make the Hall of Fame, it would not be until after he died. Condit told Fox News Digital recently that he ""began to shake"" when he heard of Rose's death, considering what Rose had told him just days prior.
Well, Rose's grim prediction is starting to look like it will come to fruition.
MLB announced on Tuesday that those on baseball's ineligible list will be reinstated after their deaths - thus, Rose is now baseball eligible, along with ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson and 15 others.

In turn, Rose is now eligible to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Condit, a former sportscaster in nearby Dayton who grew up a Reds fan (Johnny Bench was his favorite), said that if Rose were to never be reinstated, the Cincinnati Reds' celebration of Rose at Great American Ball Park on Wednesday night (scheduled before Rose's reinstatement) would have possibly been the final true celebration of Rose.
That is why Condit recently kick-started a petition to get President Donald Trump to pardon Rose, a move the president said he would do ""in the coming weeks"" back in March, before the Reds honor Rose on Wednesday night.
""I love the fact that President Trump is considering using his pulpit to make this right, at least in the eyes of millions of baseball fans who say ‘he did a lot of bad things off the field, he lied, but darn it, statistically he should be in the Hall of Fame.’ And that can’t happen unless baseball says ‘we’re going to reinstate him,'"" Condit said in an interview with Fox News Digital before MLB's recent decision.
Baseball ended up saying that.
Condit does not need to rely on the president anymore, and it is now increasingly likely that Rose will be celebrated in upstate New York.

(IMAGN)
""I'm extremely happy. My fear was if this did not happen, that the greatest moment for Pete Rose after his passing would be Wednesday night at Cincinnati. Instead, we've got a celebration in Cincinnati that we didn't have three hours ago,"" Condit told Fox News Digital shortly after Rose's reinstatement. ""Now, we got a real shot, a real shot for him to get into the Hall of Fame, which is what Pete Rose fans want. So I'm ecstatic.""
The Hall of Fame decided in 1991, two years after Rose's ban, that it would not have voting processes for players on baseball's ineligible list. As long as Rose was barred from the sport, the Hall did not budge.
So, Trump and Manfred met last month, and it is largely assumed they spoke about Rose. Condit said he is ""grateful"" to both Trump and Manfred for Rose's significantly boosted odds (no pun intended) of getting into Cooperstown.

2-TIME MVP BRYCE HARPER TURNS BACK THE CLOCK WITH MAJOR CHANGE AMID SLUMP
""I believe [Trump] played a significant role in this for two reasons. One, he loves baseball, he loves Pete Rose. Two, who wants to say no to a president?"" Condit said. ""Who wants to get on the wrong side of a president when there's so much up? I give Commissioner Manfred a lot of credit. He could have toed the line and said, 'I'm going to stay with the tradition of keeping this punishment in place, and it is a punishment.' Or 'I'm going to turn a page and offer forgiveness to Pete, Joe Jackson and others.' People are going to love this.""
Condit's history with Rose dates back to the 1980s. He was actually interviewing Rose in 1989 when one of Rose's agents interrupted to inform Rose that MLB had begun an investigation into him for gambling. He was also in the press room when then-MLB Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti announced Rose's lifetime ban from the game.
""In 1989, before he got banned, I was at an event that Boomer Esiason ran for cystic fibrosis in the Cincinnati area. When Pete was done interviewing with me, I gave him a letter I wrote out and said, ‘When you get on the plane, please read this.’ And it said ‘if you did it, admit it. We’re a very forgiving society, nobody’s perfect, but if you did it, come clean now, and you will be forgiven by society. It’ll be OK,’"" Condit said in an interview with Fox News Digital before MLB announced its new ruling.
""When I interviewed him [last year], I asked him about that – he didn’t remember it, but I asked if he could do it differently. He said, 'No. I thought I could get away with it.""
That is why Condit understands both sides of the argument. Rose gambled on the game, lied about it for years and never seemed truly remorseful. Condit even said he wouldn't blame anybody for voting against Rose.
""No saint. In fact, did a lot wrong,"" Condit recently described Rose.

However, ""I believe in second chances and third chances and maybe seven chances. And I think statistically it's a great time to say, you know what? He paid his price. It's time for him to go to the Hall of Fame.""
Condit said he hopes the Rose family can eventually forgive Baseball and the Hall of Fame - even for Condit himself, there is still some anger.
""But all that ends well can be well, and this could end very, very well.""

Craig Carton, Danny Parkins, and Mark Schlereth discuss the matchup, and what it means for the NFL.
The NFL is playing seven international games during the 2025 season, and there is some history involved on multiple levels.
Almost all the games and teams involved were announced on Tuesday, and each destination has been set.
London, which has been the sight of NFL regular-season games since 2007, will have three contests. The NFL is also heading back to Brazil and Germany, while two countries will have its first taste of regular season football this year.

Dublin, Ireland and Madrid, Spain will also host teams vying for the Vince Lombardi Trophy next season. Here’s the full rundown of who will be playing in each game:

It was reported the Kansas City Chiefs were going to travel to Brazil to face their AFC West-rival Chargers, though the announcement with exact opponents should come Wednesday.
Also, it’s worth noting that the Vikings will become the first team in NFL history to play in two separate countries on back-to-back weeks. Their dynamic offense, which is expected to be led by J.J. McCarthy next season, will be on full display in Ireland and the United Kingdom early in the schedule.

Continuing the global initiative is what the NFL has made a point in doing, and that includes increasing the number of international games on the regular season schedule.
London was the main hub for building NFL fandom, but in 2022, the league also started to make its presence known in Germany. The Falcons-Colts matchup will be the fifth game played in the country since that year.

MLB found Rose gambled on his Cincinnati Reds as both a player and manager, although he insisted he never bet on his team to lose. Rose denied the accusations until 2004. He sought reinstatement several times but was never welcomed back by MLB before his death in September 2024.
Rose predicted just 10 days before his death that he wouldn’t make the Baseball Hall of Fame until after he died, if at all.
The news about Rose shocked the baseball world, and fans immediately began lobbying for Rose's induction into the Hall of Fame.

""Pete Rose didn’t give Pete Rose a shot to get into the Baseball Hall of Fame,"" Chris Rose explained in his reaction video posted on social media. ""We’re always looking to point the finger at somebody else as to why we can’t do this or we weren’t given that shot. My guess is that Pete Rose would’ve had ample opportunity to do this if he would’ve looked himself in the mirror and said, ‘You have to clean up your act,’ which he never did.
""For 15 years after A. Bartlett Giamatti, the commissioner at the time, said, ""Pete, you’re out,’ he never admitted to betting on baseball. You know when he finally did? When he could turn a quick buck, when he could turn out a book. And then he started saying, ‘Yeah, I did bet on baseball, but I only I bet on my team to win when I was managing them.’""
Manfred wrote about his decision in a letter to attorney Jeffrey M. Lenkov.

""Obviously, a person no longer with us cannot represent a threat to the integrity of the game,"" Manfred wrote in the letter obtained by ESPN. ""Moreover, it is hard to conceive of a penalty that has more deterrent effect than one that lasts a lifetime with no reprieve. Therefore, I have concluded that permanent ineligibility ends upon the passing of the disciplined individual, and Mr. Rose will be removed from the permanently ineligible list.""
President Donald Trump, who met with Manfred last month, announced in March he would pardon Rose, who served five months in prison in 1990. In 2017, Rose was also accused of statutory rape from an alleged encounter decades earlier.
""Major League Baseball didn’t have the courage or decency to put the late, great, Pete Rose, also known as ‘Charlie Hustle,’ into the Baseball Hall of fame. Now he is dead, will never experience the thrill of being selected, even though he was a FAR BETTER PLAYER than most of those who made it, and can only be named posthumously. WHAT A SHAME!"" Trump posted.

While Rose has a good shot to make it into the Hall, Jackson’s chances are slim to none. It is widely assumed he took part in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, in which seven others were banned from the game for fixing the World Series that year.
As a result of Manfred’s decision, 17 deceased players have been removed from MLB's permanently ineligible list.

Hunter Mahan recorded his best finish at the PGA Championship in 2014, finishing in a tie for seventh place that year.
Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, will host pro golfers for this year's PGA Championship.
The opening round tees off Thursday, but Mahan is already sharing an interesting observation about this year's golf course.

""I guess I would say Quail Hollow is like a Kardashian,"" Mahan told The Athletic. ""It’s very modern, beautiful and well-kept. But it lacks a soul or character.""
Elsewhere, Dean Burmester also weighed in on Quail Hollow, describing the course as a ""monster"" and admitting he had only experienced the course through pixels.
""I haven’t seen it, but I’ve played it on PlayStation quite a few times. It’s a monster, right?"" Burmester noted.

Olivia Dunne was ecstatic Tuesday after seeing her first-ever Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover.

Dunne dazzled in an animal-print bikini by Reina Olga for her cover, which was shot in Bermuda.
The other cover models are Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles, accomplished actress Salma Hayek and entrepreneur Lauren Chan.
Dunne also shared the cover on her Instagram story, captioning the post, ""I’m a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover girl!""
LIVVY DUNNE POSTS EMOTIONAL ‘THANK YOU’ TO GYMNASTICS AFTER CAREER ENDS
Dunne has been featured in the previous two Sports Illustrated Swimsuit editions, and she's excited to see herself on the cover for the first time.
She has appeared alongside other swimsuit models in New York this week to promote the new edition, which included a stop at Citi Field for the New York Mets-Pittsburgh Pirates game.
Dunne is the girlfriend of Pirates star pitcher Paul Skenes, who got the start on Monday night in Queens. He went six innings, allowing one earned run on six hits and three walks, while striking out six batters. The Pirates fell to the Mets, 4-3.

Before the game, swimsuit models Camille Kostek, Ellie Thumann and Xandra Pohl all threw ceremonial first pitches. Dunne decided not to participate.
Dunne recently wrapped up her LSU Tigers gymnastics career after the program failed to repeat as a national champion late last month.
The New Jersey native posted a montage of images from her gymnastics career, from the time she was a toddler in leotards to the moment she became a national champion.
""'Time flies when you're having fun.' Something said that when you’re enjoying yourself to the point time seems to slip away from you. That’s exactly how the past 20 years in this sport have felt,"" Dunne said in the video. ""The highs, the lows, making the USA national team and competing for our country. Every risk was worth the reward. Finishing my career over the past five years at the best university in the world has been an incredible journey, and I'm forever grateful.

Colin Cowherd discusses whether the series is over.
The Boston Celtics entered this year's NBA playoffs with the top seed in the Eastern Conference. But the Celtics will have to overcome a 3-1 series deficit if the team is to keep hopes of defending its NBA title alive.
The New York Knicks' 121-113 victory on Monday night pushed the reigning champions to the brink of elimination. But much of the postgame discussion centered around the health of Celtics star Jayson Tatum.

Speculation quickly began to swirl that Tatum had injured his Achilles.
On Tuesday, the Celtics confirmed the star forward ruptured his right Achilles tendon. The team also announced that Tatum underwent a medical procedure to repair the torn tendon.

The Celtics described Tatum's surgery as ""successful,"" but cautioned that there is currently ""no timetable"" for his return. The 27-year-old is expected to make a full recovery, per the Celtics.
Tatum lunged toward the ball as he tried to regain possession for the Celtics at the 2:58 mark in the fourth quarter. He then appeared to experience a serious issue with his right leg, before immediately calling a timeout.

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/california-high-school-girls-track-meet-officials-protect-girls-sports-shirts","High school girls allege track meet officials forced them to take off 'Protect Girls Sports' shirts","California girls' track and field athletes Lily Ingallinera, Julia Teven, Reese Hogan and Olivia Viola allege CIF officials forced them to take off their shirts that read 'Protect Girls Sports' during a meet that featured a transgender competitor.
EXCLUSIVE: The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) came under fire this week for a postseason track meet that saw a biologically male trans athlete place in the top nine of three girls' events.
The CIF Southern Section Division 3 Prelims at Yorba Linda High School on Saturday erupted into a political rally over the issue of trans inclusion in girls' sports with multiple competitors and attendees wearing shirts that read ""Protect Girls Sports,"" hoisting picket signs and speaking out at a press conference.
During the meet, officials allegedly made athletes remove the ""Protect Girls Sports"" shirts, suppressing their desire to voice opposition to the CIF gender eligibility policy. The CIF has acknowledged to Fox News Digital that the incidents did occur, and that the girls had their school uniforms on under the shirts.
""Per the CIF Southern Section Playoff Bulletin, all athletes must be dressed in proper, school issued, track uniforms. The student-athletes were asked to comply with this while in the on-field event area, as they were wearing said shirts over their school-issued uniform,"" the CIF said in a statement.
However, witnesses have told Fox News Digital that the officials did not give the same orders to athletes wearing other non-school-uniform shirts without the ""Protect Girls Sports"" message.
The protests came in response to a biologically male trans athlete who competed in the girls' high jump, long jump and triple jump for Jurupa Valley High School.

The trans athlete ultimately finished in the top nine in the girls' high jump, long jump and finished in first place in the triple jump. By virtue of placing in the top-nine in all those events, the athlete will advance in the state semifinals, while the three female athletes who finished in 10th place in those events will all miss out.
Meanwhile, many of the athletes who competed had to wait through an hours-long intermission after temperatures exceeded 100 degrees Fahrenheit, putting the event in a weather delay due to dangerous heat levels.
Multiple female competitors told Fox News Digital that officials at the meet allegedly approached them and told them to remove the shirts, and did not give the girls the liberty to go and take them off elsewhere. The girls allege the officials made them take off the shirts immediately, under the officials' supervision, and didn't give them any additional time or opportunities to do it elsewhere.
""They didn't let us go and do anything unless we removed the shirt,"" 15-year-old Brea Olinda High School student Lily Ingallinera said. ""They said, ‘you have to remove it right now!’ … He didn't leave until we took it off.""
Fellow Brea Olinda student Julia Teven, 17, alleged that an official gave similar orders to her.
""You could tell he was not going to take no for an answer,"" Teven said. ""He was standing right there watching us like ‘you better take it off’. That's basically how it kind of felt.""
Ingallinera added that she found the official's orders ""weird,"" and preferred it if he asked her coach or a female official to relay the message instead.
""I thought it was a little weird that this grown man was coming up to us and persistently saying ‘I need you to take it off.' I think they should have told our coaches to come tell us instead of this official that I know is older than us and a grown adult and I feel like either a woman should have done it or he should have done it on the speaker telling everyone and not just individually telling everyone,"" Ingallinera said.
Teven and Crean Lutheran student Reese Hogan, 16, alleged that officials made them feel that if they did not take off their shirts, then they would be disqualified from the event.
""It wasn't said but it was implied that if I didn't take my shirt off then and there, then something could potentially happen to my spot, it wasn't said but it was implied,"" Hogan said. ""Throughout the day it was kind of getting a little bit more stricter… getting a little bit more hostile with their voices… they never said anything about getting disqualified, but it was kind of implied by the tone of their voice and the way that they said things.""
TEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO A CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND
The girls alleged the officials at the meet went up to other athletes who wore the ""Protect Girls Sports"" shirts and made those athletes remove them as well.
Hogan added that she was forced to remove her shirt on the field during warm-ups and then again at the gate after stepping out of the venue and trying to come back in, while her hands were full of other supplies.
""I was like ‘Is it okay if I walk in and take it off? I don't really have hands right now’ and she was like ‘No, you’re going to have to take it off, you can't come in here with that shirt on,'"" Hogan alleged. ""They kind of were just making us take the shirts off wherever we were.""
Teven, Hogan and fellow Crean Lutheran student Olivia Viola said the officials told them the reasoning behind asking to remove the shirts was because the shirts weren't official school uniforms. However, the girls also said that other athletes wearing gear with college names or other brands that weren't official school uniforms weren't asked to remove their shirts.

""I just found it really, like, really, it felt like it was unfair, just kind of targeted at, at what we were standing for, because the shirts weren't saying anything offensive. It wasn't derogatory. All it was saying was to protect women's sports,"" Viola said. ""And it was really clear that they only wanted our shirts off because of what we were supporting and didn't care about the actual role because of the other athletes that were wearing.""
All four girls claim that the police presence at the meet was heightened to levels they had never seen at a high school track meet, as the event became a hotbed for debate over the national conflict over trans athletes in girls' sports. Jurupa Valley's trans competitor has prompted controversy throughout the season, breaking long-held girls' records at various meets.
CALIFORNIA GIRL OPENS UP ON FIGHTING LEGAL AND POLITICAL BATTLE OVER TRANS ATHLETES AFTER LIFE-CHANGING PAIN
In addition to the shirts and a press conference where students, parents and community leaders spoke out against the CIF and California state government for continuing to protect trans inclusion, the crowd of spectators in attendance boisterously either cheered or jeered the trans competitor throughout the day.
Footage on social media shows some spectators chanting ""that's a boy!"" at the athlete, while Viola said other fans only cheered for the trans athlete during the event while remaining silent for the female competitors.
""I know it was like, really, really split, specifically, like when he was jumping, and it was like you could visibly see it, almost like it felt like half the stadium was, like, against it. And then there was like a little chunk of people over here that would, like, cheer really loudly for everything he did,"" Viola said.
""It just was bothersome to me. It was a little bit sad to hear people cheering louder for the biological male competing in a female sport than the females competing in the female sports. That part was just a little bit, that part was saddening to me.""
However, the four girls also expressed sympathy for the athlete over the insults that were hurled at it by the other spectators.
""I don't, I don't condone the like, the bullying, the yelling of this person. I think it's 100% on the people in authority who are allowing it to happen,"" Viola said.
Teven and Ingallinera say they even spoke to the athlete during breaks on Saturday, and don't believe the athlete is at fault for the situation
""I genuinely believe he doesn't have a harmful intent towards girls sports. I think it's the kind of like CIF allowing him that's kind of put him in his position,"" Teven said. ""I think genuinely, he's just, like, being enabled by the CIF, and he's just taking his opportunity presented to him.""
Ingallinera even said the athlete was ""very nice"" and believes the CIF is putting the athlete in an unfair position.
""I did talk to this guy, and he was very, he was very respectful, very kind. He didn't really say anything hurtful things. I didn't say anything rude to him. And I was just like, there he was very nice,"" Ingallinera said. ""I think that if CIF didn't allow them to compete, they would be competing with the guys division instead of the girls.""
The CIF is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for allowing trans athletes to compete in girls' sports, and potential Title IX violations.
California was one of the first states to openly defy President Donald Trump's ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order after he signed it on Feb. 5.
""The CIF provides students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete in education-based experiences in compliance with California law [Education Code section 221.5. (f)] which permits students to participate in school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, consistent with the student’s gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the student’s records,"" the CIF previously said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

California Governor Gavin Newsom addressed the issue during an episode of his podcast in early March.
""Well, I think it's an issue of fairness,"" Newsom said to conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. ""I completely agree with you on that. It's deeply unfair.
""So that's easy to call out the unfairness of that. There's also a humility and a grace… these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.
""So both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think you know is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue?
""The question you're asking is the question we've been asking ourselves for months and haven't been able to answer. What is that line? How can you make this fair? I haven't been able to figure it out, and I'm about as transparent about this as anybody out there, especially in my party on this. To the extent someone can and do it in a way that's respectful and responsible and could find the kind of balance, then I'm open to that discussion.""
Fox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office on the latest controversy but has not heard back.

The New York Yankees placed infielder Oswaldo Cabrera on the 10-day injured list after he sustained a gruesome injury in the team’s 11-5 win over the Seattle Mariners Monday night at T-Mobile Park.
The injury occurred in the top of the ninth inning. The bases were loaded with one out for the Yankees, Cabrera was the runner on third base and Aaron Judge hit a fly ball to right field.
Cabrera tagged up once the ball was caught and hustled home.
Cabrera tried to avoid Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh’s tag, and, as Cabrera stopped to try and touch home plate, he slid awkwardly and injured his ankle.

The YES broadcast picked up Cabrera audibly distraught on the field as he writhed in pain at home plate. Medical personnel raced out onto the field to tend to Cabrera.
WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO
Cabrera’s ankle was placed in a brace before he was put on a stretcher and taken into an ambulance on the field, Yankees’ manager Aaron Boone said.
Judge said after the game that Cabrera asked him if he had scored the run before he was taken off the field.
""So, just kind of shows you what type of guy he is,"" Judge said. ""Something like that happens and the one thing on his mind for all the pain and everything is, ‘Did I score?’

""He cares for everybody in this room. He loves being a Yankee,"" Judge said of Cabrera. ""He wears his jersey with pride. This is a tough one, especially a guy that’s grinded his whole life and finally got an opportunity to be our everyday guy and been excelling at it.""
Cabrera had been getting most of the starts at third base for the Yankees this season. In the past, he's been used as a utility man who could fill in and play all over the diamond.
In 34 games this season, Cabrera has a .243 batting average with one home run and 11 RBIs. During his four-year career, the 26-year-old has a .234 batting average with 34 home runs.

DJ LeMahieu was activated off the injured list as the corresponding move to replace Cabrera on the roster.
LeMahieu had been hampered by calf and hip issues throughout spring training and had been on the injured list since the beginning of the season. He will make his season debut this week.
The Yankees' (24-17) play the Mariners (22-18) at 9:40 p.m. ET Tuesday.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at an MLB game is a special moment.
Many of the individuals who've been given the opportunity have gone on to cherish the moment, but broadcaster Siera Santos' time on the pitching mound appeared to quickly go from a dream to a nightmare.
Santos, who co-hosts the MLB Network's ""Intentional Talk,"" was asked to toss the ceremonial first pitch ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks game against the Los Angeles Dodgers this past Friday.

Santos acknowledged the pressure she experienced leading up to her moment in the spotlight.

She told the Arizona Republic her colleagues would likely roast her ""for the rest of eternity"" should she effectively drop the ball. It appears Santos' concerns proved to be valid as her pitch sailed to the left of home plate.
During her routine appearance on the MLB Network program on Monday, Santos took a moment to revisit the failed pitch.
""Alright guys, let's address the elephant in the room and address the most embarrassing day of my life,"" Santos told Kevin Millar and Ryan Dempster.

""I'm honestly surprised my badge still worked when I walked in the door today. I absolutely botched this first pitch. It wasn’t a first pitch; it was an abomination! I seriously considered changing my name and moving to a different country,"" Santos said.
Santos also made it clear that she tried to be prepared for the moment. ""People are like, ‘Why didn’t you practice?’ I did practice! I was at a Little League field right beforehand, and I was sailing it over home plate.""
While Santos admittedly felt the sting in the days since the brutal pitch, she could soon have a shot at redemption. A recent post to the MLB Network's Instagram account, citing sources, claimed ""A redemption first pitch is in the works.""

One of the premier looks of Major League Baseball is no more.
Bryce Harper's hair has matched up with his baseball resume – the two-time MVP had grown his hair out for quite some time, and it became one of the best hairdos in the game.
But on Tuesday night, he stunned the baseball world when he went with a similar haircut to his rookie season.

Harper was rocking a short top and a high skin fade on the sides and a faux-hawk type in the back.
Perhaps Harper felt a change was necessary, as he had been hitting .212 in his last 22 games. But the magic of the haircut didn't help much, as he went 0-for-3 in a 3-2 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals.

The outfielder-turned-first baseman is now hitting just .232 on the season, and .205 since April 17.
Harper came up in 2012 sporting short hair that he progressively grew – and it became noticeably longer in 2015, the first year he won an MVP. Shortly after winning his second one in 2021, he got a haircut, but he grew it back out again over the last couple of years.

North Carolina Tar Heels head coach Bill Belichick made clear on Tuesday that Jordon Hudson ""doesn’t have anything to do"" with the football program.
It was Belichick’s first remarks since the CBS interview debacle, which featured Hudson interrupting a question about their relationship and dueling statements about how the interview went down.

He appeared on ESPN’s ""SportsCenter"" as the ACC’s Spring Meetings got underway and was asked by Christine Williamson how the off-field drama has impacted his ability to coach the team.
""That’s really off to the side. That’s a personal relationship and she doesn’t have anything to do with UNC football,"" Belichick said.
""I’m excited to be back in the coaches’ meetings and getting ready for June and August when we get to training camp. June will be a big recruiting month for us and then August we start getting ready for the season.""
Hudson may not have an official role within the program, but email correspondence within the athletics department appeared to show she was a part of his media team in some capacity.
Hudson emailed school officials showing concern about ""salacious"" commentary on social media, The Athletic reported last month.
""Is there anyone monitoring the UNC Football page for slanderous commentary and subsequently deleting it / blocking users that are harassing BB in the comments?"" Hudson reportedly asked on Feb. 13.

Belichick reportedly followed up the next day, ""I cannot believe that UNC would support my being called a ‘predator.’""
Robbi Pickeral Evans, UNC senior associate athletic director for external affairs and strategic communications, replied that the social media team hides or erases comments about personal life.
""UNC would NEVER support,"" Evans reportedly said in her reply.
Hudson also reportedly expressed concerns about fans calling out ""nepotism,"" given that Belichick's son, Steve, is the team's defensive coordinator.
Belichick reportedly asked UNC staff to include Hudson on emails moving forward.
North Carolina was forced to refute a report last week after journalist Pablo Torre said Hudson had been barred from the facility and the field at the school.

""While Jordon Hudson is not an employee at the University or Carolina Athletics, she is welcome to the Carolina Football facilities.

NBC announced that Michael Jordan will be a special contributor to their NBA coverage when it begins in the 2025-2026 season on Monday.
Longtime sports broadcaster Kevin Harlan talked about what the public should expect from Jordan behind the desk.
""I think when you talk about perhaps the greatest player who has ever played our game, it’s always the inside stuff, which I think is most captivating,"" Harlan said during a recent appearance on OutKick’s ""Don’t @ Me with Dan Dakich.""

""You don’t have to rattle off stats, you can talk about your personal experience, and if you talk about his battles with Reggie Miller and talk about how he prepared for a Game 7 or how he prepared for a new series or how he prepared for sections of the regular season. I think that’s what people – they want to see what’s behind the curtain.""
""We all have access to the numbers, we read the stories, but I want Jordan to tell me stuff that I don’t know.""
Harlan cited an interview he did with the late Kobe Bryant, and how insightful he was, and Harlan would want Jordan to provide similar insight.
""To hear Kobe talk in detail about footwork, positioning, reads, schemes, all of it, preparation, day of preparation, after-game routine, like that’s the kind of stuff I want to hear Jordan talk about,"" Harlan said.

""We have a barrage of stories from hosts and their analysts, those are great, there is only one Michael Jordan, there is only one Kobe Bryant, and to hear them talk about various facets of the game,"" Harlan said.
""You don’t have to be there dishing off 18 different things, pick one thing, pick two things, take people behind the scenes and back of the curtain and unveil what it’s like to be in that position for that coach for that team. Some personal experience, not ‘Well in my day’ not that kind of stuff, but one way to prepare against a great defender is dot dot dot.""

NBC carried the rights to the NBA from 1990-2002, Jordan’s peak years. After 23 years without it, the NBA will return to the network when their 11-year contract begins in October.
""I am so excited to see the NBA back on NBC,"" Jordan said during a video message. ""The NBA on NBC was a meaningful part of my career, and I’m excited about being a special contributor to the project. I’m looking forward to seeing you all when the NBA on NBC launches this October.""
Jordan had not been a part of any network since his retirement, but did have a documentary about his career, ""The Last Dance,"" air on ESPN in 2020.

"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mlb-removes-pete-rose-other-banned-players-from-permanently-ineligible-list","MLB removes Pete Rose, other banned players from permanently ineligible list","President Trump and the Rose family are asking Major League Baseball to honor the memory of the late Pete Rose.
Efforts to get Pete Rose into Cooperstown took a step forward Tuesday.
Rose, MLB's all-time hit king who was ousted for gambling, was removed from Major League Baseball's permanently ineligible list after MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred announced players' ineligibility from the game ends upon their deaths.
""Obviously, a person no longer with us cannot represent a threat to the integrity of the game,"" Manfred wrote in a letter, obtained by ESPN, to attorney Jeffrey M. Lenkov.
""Moreover, it is hard to conceive of a penalty that has more deterrent effect than one that lasts a lifetime with no reprieve. Therefore, I have concluded that permanent ineligibility ends upon the passing of the disciplined individual, and Mr. Rose will be removed from the permanently ineligible list.""
CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

MLB made the announcement in a press release.
""This issue has never been formally addressed by Major League Baseball, but an application filed by the family of Pete Rose has made it incumbent upon the Office of the Commissioner to reach a policy decision on this unprecedented issue in the modern era as Mr. Rose is the first person banned after the tenure of Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis to die while still on the ineligible list. Commissioner Manfred has concluded that MLB’s policy shall be that permanent ineligibility ends upon the passing of the disciplined individual,"" MLB said.
Rose admitted to gambling in 2004 after years of claiming his innocence. He died in September and predicted 10 days before his death he would not make the Hall of Fame until after he died, if at all.
It was found that Rose gambled on the Reds, only to win, while he was both a manager and a player.
President Donald Trump announced in March he would pardon Rose, who served five months in prison in 1990. In 2017, Rose was accused of statutory rape from an encounter decades earlier.

""Major League Baseball didn’t have the courage or decency to put the late, great, Pete Rose, also known as ‘Charlie Hustle,’ into the Baseball Hall of fame. Now he is dead, will never experience the thrill of being selected, even though he was a FAR BETTER PLAYER than most of those who made it, and can only be named posthumously. WHAT A SHAME!"" Trump posted.
""Anyway, over the next few weeks I will be signing a complete PARDON of Pete Rose, who shouldn’t have been gambling on baseball, but only bet on HIS TEAM WINNING. He never betted against himself, or the other team. He had the most hits, by far, in baseball history, and won more games than anyone in sports history. Baseball, which is dying all over the place, should get off its fat, lazy a--, and elect Pete Rose, even though far too late, into the Baseball Hall of Fame!""
Trump and Manfred met last month.
In 1991, two years after Rose was banned by A. Bartlett Giamatti, the National Baseball Hall of Fame voted to make those ineligible from baseball also ineligible for potential induction into Cooperstown. It is not yet clear when Rose will be up for a vote, but ESPN notes it will likely be up to the Classic Baseball Era Committee, which considers players whose careers ended more than 15 years ago. That committee does not meet until December 2027, and he would need 12 of the 16 votes to get in.
Manfred's decision comes one day before the Reds host ""Pete Rose Night."" Rose had applied for reinstatement several times, but Manfred declined, at one time citing a ""risk of future violation.""

The ruling also effectively increases ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson's chances of getting into Cooperstown. He was accused of taking part in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. Seven others were then banned from the game for fixing the World Series that year.
Overall, 17 players are now baseball eligible.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The state of Maine has continued to go against President Donald Trump's executive order of keeping biological males out of girls' and women's sports.
The back-and-forth has been highly publicized and even included a war of words between Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills.
The Department of Education also launched a Title IX investigation into the state, while the Department of Agriculture froze federal funding, a decision that was reversed by a federal judge.

The state of Maine dropped its lawsuit against Trump once the funds were unfrozen, but there seems to be no clear resolution yet. And Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., ripped Mills for her actions against Trump.
Tuberville appeared on OutKick's ""Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich"" and was asked if there are any repercussions for states that defy the order.
""Well, if it’s a federally funded entity, it is. And of course, this Maine governor, who is a complete idiot, is fighting against the president of the United States,"" Tuberville said. ""He told her, you cannot use federal funding, ‘Oh yeah we are going to do that anyway, we don’t care what you say, you’re not the boss.’ Yeah, he’s the president of the United States. Cut their funding off, cut them at the knees, make it hurt.
""We hate it for the athletes up there, we hate it for kids who actually want to get an education but make them hurt. And as I’ve said before, there are entire teams across the country that are women’s teams that are made up of transgender boys, entire track teams. It is a disaster and it’s picking up speed.""

Tuberville added that there wasn't much for Trump to do due to state funding, but ripped the ""woke"" governors.
""These governors need to stand up and grow some and stand up for the women in this country, but they’re not going to do it. They are so woke, they are so over the top with all this nonsense that, ‘Oh yes, we’ve got to be nice everybody.' How about being nice to women for once? Although you can’t define a woman.""
The U.S. Justice Department announced a lawsuit on April 16 against the state of Maine for its continued defiance of Trump’s executive order to keep biological males out of girls' and women’s sports and alleged violations of Title IX.

Craig Carton, Danny Parkins, and Mark Schlereth discuss the conspiracies surrounding this selection after the Mavericks traded away Luka Doncic.
Chicago hosted the NBA's annual draft lottery on Monday night. Despite entering the lottery with just 1.8% odds, the Dallas Mavericks landed the top selection for this year's upcoming draft.
But the Mavericks were not the only franchise to experience some unexpected good fortune in Chicago. The San Antonio Spurs and Philadelphia 76ers also landed the rights to picks in the top three. The night's surprising events prompted a strong response from Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant.

""Tanking must be really stressful on a organization,"" the 2014 NBA MVP wrote on X.

The Charlotte Hornets once again finished well below the .500 mark, ending the 2024-25 season with less than 20 wins. The Washington Wizards, who held the second overall selection in last year's draft, also failed to record more than 20 wins this past regular season.
Despite the lackluster records and relatively strong odds of landing a top pick, the Hornets and Wizards both ultimately earned selections outside the top three.
The NBA lottery odds have noticeably flattened in the past few years, which makes it more unlikely that teams who hit the reset button will end up being rewarded with the rights to a top three selection.

Former ESPN journalist Pablo Torre said last week that North Carolina had banned Hudson from football facilities amid the widespread scrutiny. The school subsequently denied the claim.
An important date has been mentioned this week amid the firestorm Belichick and his girlfriend have been engulfed in. The date is June 1.
Pro Football Talk noted that June 1 is the date that his buyout clause goes from $10 million to $1 million. Torre sounded the alarm in a podcast interview on Monday, predicting that the legendary New England Patriots head coach may not make it to the team’s first game of the 2025 season against the TCU Horned Frogs.

""I think there’s a chance, an absolutely real chance that he doesn’t (make it to Week 1),"" he said on ""The Dominique Foxworth Show."" ""And the reason I say that is because even before the Jordon Hudson thing became as public, even before it went from messy backstage to now, obviously messy everywhere, the date that matters the most is June 1.""
Torre suggested that because, based on his reporting, North Carolina officials are bringing the hammer down on Hudson and treating the coach as an employee rather than the boss he was in the NFL, then it would push Belichick out of the job completely.
""That’s before you even consider the fact that stuff is so crazy when it comes to how his family feels, how the people around the school feel, that there’s this larger, ‘Hy, so coach met this woman when she was 19 years old on an airplane and now she’s kind of running his public image as his girlfriend,'"" he said. ""Is this something that’s sustainable? Is that fireable? What does he have to do to get fired? These are all active questions.""
Hudson has reportedly been heavily involved in Belichick's professional life since he was hired to be UNC's football coach in December. One report said she struck down the idea of the Tar Heels program being featured in ""Hard Knocks.""

She and Belichick both reportedly expressed concern about fan vitriol, particularly about their relationship, if UNC were to underperform. Apparently, Belichick had asked UNC staff to include Hudson in all emails moving forward.

Isabelle St. Cyr, a transgender beauty pageant competitor who competed in Miss Maine USA over the weekend, opened up about an interaction with Jordon Hudson behind the scenes.
Hudson was the second runner-up in the pageant amid a tumultuous few weeks that started when she shut down a question for her boyfriend Bill Belichick about how the two met. The interruption was during Belichick’s CBS interview about his new book in which he described Hudson as his ""creative muse.""

St. Cyr said the conversation with Hudson was about the media scrutiny they both received coming into the pageant.
""We had a conversation backstage and we were like, 'You know, the media hasn't necessarily been kind to us.' We just kind of talked about how we've dealt with it, how to move forward, how to remain positive and when to comment and not to comment,"" St. Cyr told People in a story published Tuesday. ""I really appreciate her willingness to talk to me about the media coverage.""

St. Cyr lamented the media coverage and said they both expected negativity because ""that’s how people get clicks."" St. Cyr said Hudson helped her realize they were not alone in that regard.
""And she admits that a lot of backlash still showed up to the pageant that night to compete, and I as well, with a lot of backlash and a lot of people saying that I shouldn't be there.""
Shelby Howell, of Bangor, was named Miss Maine USA.
St. Cyr, of Monson, was a semifinalist. Hudson, who represented Hancock, won the ""style"" award.
Hudson appeared to have a message for critics during the event. She was asked how she was doing before launching into her answer.
""I’m feeling an immense amount of pride right now,"" she said via Mass Live. ""I hope anyone who’s watching this finds the strength to push through whatever it is that they’re going through and embodies that hate never wins.""
When asked what moment in life she would want to go back to, Hudson said she wished she could be transported back to her family’s fishing boat.

""I think about this often because there’s a mass exodus for fishermen occurring in the rural areas of Maine, and I don’t want to see more fishermen leave this place,"" she said. ""As your next Miss Maine USA, I would make a point to go to communities… to go into the government and advocate for these people so that they don’t have to think about these memories as a past moment.""

NCAA President Charlie Baker said Monday he was ""up for anything"" when asked about reports that President Donald Trump is set to create a commission on college sports.
The presidential commission would tackle issues the college sports landscape faces with former Alabama Crimson Tide football coach Nick Saban and billionaire Cody Campbell leading it, Yahoo Sports reported last week.

""I think the fact that there's an interest on the executive side on this, I think it speaks to the fact that everybody is paying a lot of attention right now to what's going on in college sports,"" Baker said, via the Raleigh News & Observer. ""There is a lot going on, that’s not all bad, and I’m up for anything that helps us get somewhere.""
Commissioners of the top conferences in the NCAA have already asked Congress to step in to help the NCAA regulate name, image and likeness (NIL) and the transfer portal.
Greg Sankey, Jim Phillips, Tony Petitti and Brett Yormark were on Capitol Hill last month. Yormark, the Big 12 commissioner, bluntly admitted to Bret Baier on ""Special Report,"" ""We need help from Congress.""
""From where I sit today, federal preemption, having a standardized platform that oversees and governs NIL is critically important,"" Yormark said. ""Today, 34 states see it very differently, and it’s relatively unruly.""

CHARLES BARKLEY CALLS NCAA A 'BUNCH OF IDIOTS AND FOOLS' AMID CURRENT NIL LANDSCAPE
""The volume of laws that are being passed on a state level are making it really difficult for us to regulate and compete nationally,"" Petitti added. ""Every single time someone doesn’t like a ruling, or something comes from the NCAA, we end up in litigation. Those rules then get aggregated, and we’re back to the start.
""We’re hopeful that the combination of what we’ve done in the settlement will give us an opportunity, with some help from Congress, to really put a system in a place that has some stability.
""We’ve crossed the bridge of being willing to provide revenue … but we need to have some structure. We can’t have a system that has complete unregulated movement.""
It is unclear when the commission would be finalized.

The NCAA and collegiate athletes have waited for the $2.8 billion House settlement to be approved. It will allow schools to share revenue with athletes directly for the use of their NIL.

The Dallas Mavericks had a 1.8% chance of winning the NBA Draft Lottery going into the ordeal on Monday; they defied the odds and ended the day with the No. 1 overall pick.
The prize for any team was going to be former Duke Blue Devils star Cooper Flagg. He is considered one of the best young basketball players since before he even entered the collegiate ranks.

For the Mavericks, luck was on their side. Dallas made the shocking move to trade Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in February for Anthony Davis. The team still made the play-in tournament and competed to be one of the eight teams to challenge for the NBA title.
The NBA world was left dumbfounded that the Mavericks were able to get the top pick. Basketball fans spoke of ""conspiracy"" while LeBron James and Kevin Love added their own reactions to the fray.
Mavericks CEO Rick Welts was in charge of the draft lottery when the New York Knicks received the No. 1 pick in 1985 – in what theories suggested was ""rigged."" He said he spent four years debunking those theories and will likely need to debunk the 2025 lottery as well.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)
A HISTORY OF NBA DRAFT LOTTERY LEAPS: WHERE DO THE MAVERICKS RANK ALL-TIME?
""I'm the only person who was in this room and the room 40 years ago,"" Welts said, via The Washington Post. ""I was in charge of the NBA draft lottery 40 years ago when Patrick Ewing won. I've been doing conspiracy theory stories ever since. This is very surreal, personally.""
However, Welts was excited about the opportunity to select Flagg.
The San Antonio Spurs received the No. 2 pick, the Philadelphia 76ers will pick third and the Charlotte Hornets will have the fourth pick.

Colin Cowherd discusses their impact and if these bats are good for the game of baseball.
New York Yankees infielder Oswaldo Cabrera was removed from the field at T-Mobile Park in Seattle on Monday night as he suffered a serious ankle injury while running the bases.
The Yankees had the bases loaded when Aaron Judge’s sacrifice fly sent Cabrera from third base to home plate. As Cabrera went to slide around Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh, he came up lame. Cabrera writhed in pain in the dirt and appeared to be really hurt.

Medical personnel came out to attend to Cabrera, and an ambulance was called out onto the field. Cabrera’s left ankle was placed in a brace before he was put into the ambulance on a stretcher, Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.
""I think everyone understands it was a pretty serious situation,"" Boone said after the Yankees’ 11-5 victory. ""So, just praying for our guy (Cabrera) tonight and hoping for the best. Trust that he’s in good hands as he goes through the night here.""

Judge said after the game that Cabrera called him over before he left the field and asked whether he scored.
""So, just kind of shows you what type of guy he is,"" Judge said. ""Something like that happens and the one thing on his mind for all the pain and everything is, ‘Did I score?’""
Judge was 2-for-3 with a double and an RBI. He’s batting .414.
""He cares for everybody in this room. He loves being a Yankee,"" Judge said of Cabrera. ""He wears his jersey with pride. This is a tough one, especially a guy that’s grinded his whole life and finally got an opportunity to be our everyday guy and been excelling at it.""

Luce Allen, a senior transgender girl, defeated a freshman biological female by less than two-tenths of a second in a 200-meter race at a Pennsylvania high school track meet over the weekend.
Allen, of Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School, set a personal record of 25.20 seconds in the race at the SOL American meet.
Allen now has six victories on the season, including in the liberty girls' 4x400-meter relay in the same meet.

Allen's time would have been the fourth-slowest time among male 200-meter runners, including preliminary heats. The winning times for the boys were 21.72 and 21.96 seconds.
According to athletic.net, Allen has competed against girls since 2023, when Allen was a sophomore. No one with the last name ""Allen"" was listed on either the boys' or girls' roster in 2022, Allen's freshman year.
A lawyer read a statement from Allen at a Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association board of directors meeting back in March, saying that forcing transgender individuals to compete against those who share a biological gender will hurt their development.
""If you remove the ability of trans people to compete with a team that corresponds with their gender, then you’ll strip them of their opportunity to develop as people,"" Allen said, via the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""Trans athletes, like any other high school athlete, are just kids who want to compete.""
Allen's mother, Sarah Hansen, said at that meeting that she and her family have been on a journey for her to transition to the girl that she always has been, and having Allen compete against boys ""would be cruel.""

""My child is a female in her heart and soul, and according to her medical labs,"" Hansen said.
""Luce’s presence on the team fosters a spirit of unity, sportsmanship, and inclusivity,""team head coach Christopher Jackson said at that same meeting. ""They are admired for their bravery, work ethic, and unwavering commitment to the sport they love.""
Hansen said that Allen is ""not a male who wants to play against girls, not a predator who wants to find a way into the female locker room, and not a male who isn’t good enough to be a boy. She is a girl.""
The state of Pennsylvania arguably put biological males competing against girls and women on the map, when UPenn swimmer Lia Thomas won a Division I national championship in 2022.
Amid his executive order to keep biological males out of girls' and women's sports, President Donald Trump's administration began a Title IX investigation into the Ivy League School.

Burton has had success at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. In his very first race there in 2022, he finished third.
But Burton's love for ""motorsports in general"" alone has him at least somewhat interested in running the Indy 500.
""I watch F1 every weekend that I can, IndyCar as much as I can, rally cross, Formula E, motorcross, everything. I love it. For sure, if that opportunity came,"" he said.
""My true passion is NASCAR, and I would never want to leave the NASCAR space. Getting to drive in Indy in a Cup car was one of the coolest things I’ve ever done in my career. Definitely see the prestige and allure of the Indy 500, and meeting guys who have run in it, talking about what it means to those guys, it’s really cool.""

The city that never sleeps will be awake for a long time.
The New York Knicks overcame yet another double-digit deficit in the second half on Monday to take a 3-1 series lead over the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals.
The Knicks trailed by 14 with nine minutes left in the third quarter, but ended the frame on a 30-13 run to lead heading into the fourth.

And after both teams threw several jabs throughout the fourth, the Knicks eventually pulled away to a 121-113 victory.
The Celtics took a 99-98 lead with just over seven minutes to go after Jayson Tatum drilled his seventh three-pointer of the night to give him 42 points on the evening. But the Knicks were unfazed.
New York then went on another huge run, outscoring Boston 18-5 over the next five minutes.
During the span, though, Tatum appeared to suffer a serious non-contact lower leg injury while going for a loose ball. Tatum immediately called timeout himself and was carried off the court. Cameras showed him in the locker room with a towel covering his face.

The Celtics are already shockingly down 3-1 in the series, and odds go even more in the Knicks' favor if Tatum's injury is what it's feared to be.
Four of the Knicks' five starters finished with at least 20 points, with Jalen Brunson leading the way with 39.
Game 5 is back in Boston, where the Knicks won both of the first two games of the series. With a win, the Knicks will be back in the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2000.

Nobody has come from 3-1 down since Denver did it twice in 2020 at the Walt Disney World resort. It hasn't happened when a team had to win a true road game since Cleveland rallied past Golden State in the 2016 NBA Finals.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The stars were out at Citi Field on Monday as the best young pitcher in the game took the bump.
Paul Skenes started on the mound for the Pittsburgh Pirates against the first-place New York Mets. And yes, girlfriend Livvy Dunne, who grew up less than 30 miles from the Mets' ballpark, was in attendance.
Dunne's gymnastics career just ended, so she's finally getting a chance to see Skenes' sophomore season.

Dunne has also been a Sports Illustrated model in each of the last two years, and she decided to bring along some friends.
Camille Kostek (Rob Gronkowski's girlfriend), Ellie Thumann and Xandra Pohl each threw out the first pitch on Monday to Mark Vientos, Tyrone Taylor and Huascar Brazoban, doing their best impression of Skenes himself.
The models even took a selfie ahead of time. Dunne was gifted a Mets jersey from the team, which she wore, despite her boyfriend pitching against them.
Skenes finished in third place in the National League Cy Young Award vote last year and was named the NL Rookie of the Year. He became the first rookie to start an All-Star Game since Hideo Nomo in 1995. He pitched to a 1.96 ERA and struck out 11.5 batters per nine innings.

Skenes has not been as sharp as last year in his sophomore season, although his 2.77 ERA entering Monday is hardly anything to complain about.
Monday marks Skenes' first start since manager Derek Shelton was fired after Pittsburgh started 12-26. It was a move Skenes admitted he was not surprised by.
""We're 12-26. Someone's gotta be held accountable,"" he told reporters Friday. ""Unfortunately, right now, it's him.""
But Skenes said a managerial change won't do much because it's ultimately up to the players.
""Just how it goes. I don't know if it fixes the root of the issue. We just need to play better,"" he added.

When NFL division races get hot and heavy late in the 2025 season, you will be able to catch plenty of the action on a Saturday on FOX.
The network announced on Monday that it would broadcast a Saturday doubleheader on Week 16 – Dec. 20 – with four NFC teams duking it out.
One game will feature a rematch of this past season's NFC championship game as the Philadelphia Eagles, who open their season on FOX against the Dallas Cowboys, will battle the Washington Commanders in Landover, Maryland.

The other game will have the Chicago Bears hosting their longtime NFC North rival, the Green Bay Packers.
A one-hour gameshow will precede the doubleheader, the 11th by the network – a record. It's also the 31st window of games this season for FOX, the most in the league.
The Birds are coming off their second Lombardi Trophy in seven years in February when they stopped the Kansas City Chiefs from the first-ever three-peat in the Super Bowl. The Eagles defeated the Commanders, 55-23, en route to the big game in the NFC championship. Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley each had three rushing touchdowns in the game.

Both the Eagles and Commanders and the Packers and Bears split their regular-season series last year. The home team won both NFC East matchups, while the road team was victorious in the North battles.
The Packers' loss to the Bears last year came in Week 18, when it became apparent that the Packers were trying to play for seeding late in the game. But they lost, and then dropped their playoff game to the Eagles, which had been a rematch of the Week 1 contest in Brazil.

Since high school, it's long been assumed that Cooper Flagg would be the top selection of this year's NBA Draft. Now he knows where he (likely) will be heading.
The Dallas Mavericks won the NBA Draft lottery on Monday, meaning they currently own the first overall selection.
Dallas had an 8.5% chance to pick top-four and a 1.8% to win the lottery.

The Mavs' season turned into turmoil when they traded Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers, prompting fan hatred to general manager Nico Harrison, who needed heightened security throughout the rest of the season.
But all of a sudden, all seems OK in Dallas.
The Utah Jazz, with an NBA-worst 17-65 record, had the best odds at the top pick, but they dropped all the way to No. 5. Utah has never selected No. 1 nor have they ever improved their draft standing. Since the NBA changed its lottery system in 2019, the team with the best odds has never selected first.

Flagg heightened his own expectations by declaring for Duke in high school, and then he lived up to the billing.
Flagg led Duke this season in almost every statistical category, including points (709), rebounds (278), assists (155), steals (52) and blocks per game (1.4). He averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.4 steals per game, but his best showing was in January when he set an ACC freshman record with a 42-point performance against Notre Dame.
Flagg closed out a phenomenal year with a semifinal appearance in the NCAA men’s tournament and was named the winner of the 2025 Naismith Player of the Year Award, becoming just the fourth freshman to be named its recipient, along with Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis and Zion Williamson.
His Blue Devils lost a late lead against Houston, who returned the favor to Florida in the national championship.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A Miami football player was found to be the driver in a two-car crash that killed three people in the other vehicle, two of which were children, police said on Monday.
Linebacker Adarius Hayes was injured in the wreck, but was released from the hospital.
The people killed in the Kia Soul were aged 78, 10, and 4.

""We are deeply saddened to learn the crash resulted in three fatalities, as confirmed by Largo Police, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those lost,"" the Hurricanes said in a statement.
The school is still working to gather further information.
Another passenger in the Kia was hospitalized with serious injuries, police said.

""There were no signs of impairment with either driver of the vehicles,"" Largo Police public information officer Megan Santo said in a statement distributed Sunday.
The Orlando Sentinel noted that Hayes has a history of driving citations, including several instances of speeding, and another for careless driving that resulted in a separate crash.
Hayes played in 12 games as a freshman for Miami last season, mostly on special teams. He was a four-star recruit coming out of Largo High and picked Miami after drawing interest from Florida, Florida State, Alabama, Georgia, Michigan, Notre Dame and Ohio State, among others.

A woman was given the surprise of a lifetime when Travis Hunter sat next to her on a plane – except she had no idea who Hunter even was.
Hunter, of course, is the two-way football star who turned his skills into a Heisman Trophy and became the second pick of the NFL Draft last month.
But, Hunter was on a United flight last week when he sat next to Sandy Hawkins Combs, who was flattered by Hunter.

""I had the most wonderful flight home from Denver. I met the nicest young man who sat next to me. He offered to put my bag in the overhead compartment and helped me with my tray. He was always polite, saying ‘yes ma’am’ or ‘no ma’am.’ Anyone would be proud to have him as a son or grandson – so polite,"" Combs said of Hunter in a Facebook post.
At this point, though, Combs still had no idea who this stranger was. But then, other passengers started noticing him.

Yes, I was drafted by the Jags.’ I already told my sons I want his jersey,"" Combs continued.

A charity tennis match at the Vatican would have a small list of guests – but it wouldn't even include the top men's player in the world.
Pope Leo XIV recently said he considered himself ""quite the amateur tennis player,"" but one notable name would be omitted in this hypothetical match.
During a meeting between the new American pope and international media on Monday, journalists offered to play doubles, or to organize a charity match.

The pope is all for it, but the top-ranked player would be ousted through no fault of his own: his last name.
""But we can't invite [Jannik] Sinner,"" the pope cracked.
Sinner has won three grand slams, all of which have come since the 2024 Australian Open, and has quickly turned himself into the best player on the planet.
At age 23, Sinner has skyrocketed through the world rankings, and has won back-to-back grand slams.
But it doesn't sound like he's visiting Pope Leo XIV any time soon.

In the pope's defense, he does have a halfway decent excuse to exclude Sinner.
Back in February, he was given a three-month suspension by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) after twice testing positive for a banned anabolic steroid nearly a year ago.
The ban came just weeks after the Italian tennis pro won his third Grand Slam title – the suspension, though, avoided any Grand Slams.
It was found that Sinner had not intentionally used a banned substance for competitive gain.
Sinner tested positive for low levels of metabolite of clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid that can be used for ophthalmological and dermatological use, in March 2024. Eight days after the Indian Wells tournament, Sinner tested positive again in an out-of-competition sample.
According to the ITIA’s initial findings, Sinner explained that he had tested positive after receiving a massage from a trainer who had used an over-the-counter spray that contained clostebol to treat a small wound after cutting his own finger.

Sinner's suspension was lifted on May 4, and he is currently playing in his home country at the Italian Open. He will be on the hunt for his fourth grand slam when the French Open begins May 25.

Colin Cowherd discusses their impact and if these bats are good for the game of baseball.
For the first time since 1988, the New York Yankees have a new full-time play-by-play announcer on the radio.
Dave Sims replaced John Sterling, who retired early in the 2024 season but briefly returned for the postseason, on WFAN. Sims was previously the television broadcaster for the Seattle Mariners.
Sterling, of course, never missed a game from 1989 all the way until the summer of 2019, including the postseason. But Sims was not on the call for the Yankees' series this past weekend in Sacramento against the Athletics.

Sims had said on social media he would be missing the series to visit family in Seattle – before the Yankees' three-game set there this week.
Sims' absence bothered Boomer Esiason, who hosts a daily morning show on the Yankees' radio network.
""John Sterling didn't miss any games, did he? You just take a week off?"" Esiason said. ""I'm sorry, I love Dave Sims… what are you doing? You just took the Yankee job. It's supposed to be the job of your life.""
""You don't miss a Yankee… you just don't do that.""
Esiason reiterated his fondness for Sims, ""but I'm going to call it out as I see it.""

""He just got started as the Yankee announcer, he's 40 games into his career as the Yankee announcer, and he decided to take off,"" Esiason continued.
Perhaps the issue hit a sore spot for Esiason, who has traveled to call NFL games and managed to make it back to New York to host his show, which he co-hosts with Gregg Giannotti.
""I would fly to Monday night games and fly back in the middle of the night to be here in studio with Craig [Carton], especially when we were being simulcast… I have done the same thing with you, as well. It's the Yankees for God's sake,"" Esiason, the 1989 NFL MVP, said.
There was a rotation of several announcers last year for the Yankees, but they landed on Sims over the offseason.

Keyshawn Johnson explains why he's surprised that the Bengals paid Tee Higgins.
Trey Hendrickson is more than open to staying in Cincinnati, but it seems like the Bengals are forcing him out the door.
The edge rusher, who led the NFL in sacks this past season, has been critical of his organization recently, but the scathing statement he released on Monday gave a peek behind the curtain.
Back in March, the Bengals gave Hendrickson permission to seek a trade – last month, he said the communication from them had been ""poor.""

Well, that communication has apparently stopped, according to Hendrickson.
""No communication has taken place between my camp and the organization post draft,"" Hendrickson said in a statement.
""The offers prior to the draft did not reflect the vision we shared and were promised last offseason if I continued to play at a high level. Coaches are aware of these past conversations. Rather than using collaboration to get us to a point to bring me home to the team, THEY are no longer communicating. I have been eagerly awaiting a resolution of this situation, but that’s hard to do when there is no discussion and an evident lack of interest in reaching mutual goals.""

COWBOYS' GEORGE PICKENS BLAMES ALLEGED VIRAL REMARKS ABOUT STEELERS ON AI
Hendrickson finished each of the past two seasons with 17.5 sacks. He is entering the final year of his contract.
""We don't have any desires of being highest paid or, you know, first in line,"" Hendrickson said last month. ""I'm not going to go into all the details, but, like, there are things that I'm willing to do and willing not to budge on. I don't think I want to play for incentives that will be out of my control. I don't think I want to play (on a) short-term contract.... I would like to tell my wife, 'Here's where we're going to live. Here's where we're going to build a family together.' You know?""
Hendrickson turned 30 in December, has been with Cincinnati since 2021 and has been an absolute steal for them. He spent his first four seasons with the New Orleans Saints but failed to put up numbers until his final season there, recording a career-high at the time of 13.5 sacks after just 6.5 in his first three NFL seasons.

Exclusive – As mothers across the nation gather with their families and friends to celebrate Mother’s Day 2025, Fox News Digital asked second lady Usha Vance about the meaning of the holiday for her and how she'll be spending the special occasion.
Mrs. Vance shared insight into her dual roles of second lady and a mom of young children.
""The balancing act today is sometimes easier than it was when I was working full-time in the private sector because I have more control over my schedule and do not feel pulled in as many directions,"" she told Fox News Digital.

What should have been the happiest day of 17-year-old Darla Svenby’s life became quickly mired in heartbreak.
After a long night of labor at St. Margaret’s Hospital in Montgomery, Alabama, the young woman was told her baby was breech and that a C-section was necessary.
A few hours later, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy.
FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP WELCOMES MILITARY MOMS TO WHITE HOUSE FOR MOTHER'S DAY
But there was no celebration. The unwed mother had made the painful decision to allow her child to be adopted.
As the adoptive parents tingled with joy, the young mother who had just given birth was left with a hollow ache.
The young mother is shown in a photograph as a teenager.  (Darla Allgood)
""Please,"" she cried to her nurse. ""Please let me hold my baby. Just once. I need to tell him goodbye.""
Nurse Danella Walters was a woman of deep faith.
She had seen many mothers in distress during her years of service, but she also knew the hospital’s policy: Birth mothers were not permitted to bond with their babies in adoption cases.

But something about this young mother's raw grief struck her to the core.
Moments later, Darla Svenby’s own mother entered the room. She gently told her daughter that she’d seen — and even held — the baby. The young new mom couldn't stop her tears.
Mrs. Svenby reached out to hug her daughter, whispering, ""He’s perfect.""
""He’s beautiful. I prayed for him. And I promised God we would pray for him every day of our lives."" (iStock)
Those simple words settled Darla Sveny's sobs into silence.
Her mother went on, ""He’s beautiful. I prayed for him. And I promised God we would pray for him every day of our lives.""
The daughter agreed. ""We will, Mama.""

But when her mother left to buy something special for the baby to wear home, the agony returned, as did the tears.
Signing the birth certificate — giving her son a name she knew might be changed — was almost too much to bear.
Nurse Walters stood by silently, paperwork in hand, witnessing the young mother's sorrow.
This story appears in the book ""God Winks for Moms: True Stories"" by SQuire Rushnell and Louise DuArt.  (SQuire Rushnell and Louise DuArt)
Then came a ray of sunshine. During a shift change, the nurse furtively reentered the room cradling something in a blanket. Darla’s baby.
""Your broken heart was breaking mine,"" the nurse whispered.
The young mother gasped as she took her infant into her arms.
""I’ll pray for you every day. I promise.""
She inhaled his scent, kissed his tiny head. ""I love you,"" she whispered over and over. ""I’ll pray for you every day. I promise.""
The nurse would never forget that snapshot of memory.
The years passed. Darla Svenby and her high school sweetheart, Randy, married and had four sons.
The Air Force moved the family to Alaska. But every day, the mom kept her promise by praying for the son she would never forget.
Meanwhile, Danella Walters retired from nursing and raised a daughter of her own, Amanda. One night, her daughter brought home a young man named Chad.
Young Chad as a baby. He shared that he'd been adopted at birth.  (Darla Allgood)
While Walters liked him, she couldn't help sense a deep hurt that he was trying to hide.
It wasn’t long before Chad shared that he’d been adopted at birth.
""All I know is my birth mom gave me up at Jackson Hospital,"" he said, with some bitterness in his voice.
She loved him so deeply, she allowed others to give him a better life.
The retired nurse's heart skipped. She had seen that pain before.
""You should know,"" she said carefully, ""that a lot of birth mothers never stop praying and grieving for their child.""
She told him the story of a young mother, just 17, who cried out for one final chance to hold her baby. Who covered his face with kisses. She loved him so deeply, she allowed others to give him a better life.
The young man listened in silence.

Some time later, Amanda and Chad got married. When they were expecting their own first child, Chad decided to seek his birth records.
He opened the official-looking envelope at Danella Walters’ kitchen table. He stared at the name of his mother: Darla Svenby.
Then his eyes narrowed at the name of the hospital.
Meanwhile, Danella Walters' eyes were tearing up. She hadn’t remembered the name of that young girl years ago, but she was certain her suspicions were correct.

""You were born at St. Margaret’s,"" she said quietly. ""Not Jackson. I held you. And I want you to know: Your mother loved you more than anything in the world.""
It was a Godwink.
Once they found an obituary for Darla Svenby's mother, the young couple traced Darla — now Darla Allgood — to Alaska.
Darla's husband then surprised her with the news.

""Our son called,"" he told her.
""Which one?"" she said, laughing.
""No,"" he said gently. ""Our other son … Chad.""
Her knees nearly buckled. Her prayers were answered.
When mother and son — lost but found — finally met, they embraced like no time had passed at all.

The young man, now a husband, even put his head against his mom just as he did as an infant.
When the family put the pieces of the puzzle together — that Chad’s mother-in-law, Danella Walters, was the very nurse who had broken the rules and brought Darla Svenby her baby all those years before — the full beauty of God’s divinely aligned plan unfolded.
It was love.

""While she is known for championing literacy, she also supported women’s empowerment, changed the national conversation on AIDS, and took a stance supporting gay rights,"" said the first lady. (Yuri Gripas for Fox News Digital)
""Barbara Bush’s iconic commencement address at Wellesley College in 1990 remains an important moment in the conversation surrounding women’s roles in society.

Bush Koch noted a ""defining moment"" when her mother cradled an infant with HIV at a time when there was a stigma surrounding the disease.

Brian Lieberman, 22, spoke with Fox News Digital about the incident that earned him the Soldier's Medal, the highest award for heroism not involving actual conflict with an enemy.
Army Sgt. Brian Lieberman, 22, said he was ""just doing his job"" when he saved the life of a 14-year-old girl in the middle of a shooting at his apartment complex. But the United States Army believes Lieberman is an American hero, meriting the Soldier's Medal.
Lieberman, an Army medic, is assigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.The Soldier's Medal, a prestigious award since its inception in 1926, is presented to those deemed heroic through ""clearly recognizable personal hazard or danger and the voluntary risk of life.""
It is not enough to simply have been a ""good Samaritan"" or to save a life. Rather, a recipient must act without hesitation to put his or her own life on the line.

On June 5, 2023, a gunman attacked the Carrington Place apartment complex in North Carolina, shooting a teenage girl in the back. Army training instincts kicked in, and Lieberman rushed into the line of fire.""I looked out my window with my roommate and we heard people screaming and saw people running around by my complex pool, at which point I grabbed my weapon and ran out my front door while my roommate dialed 911,"" Lieberman said to Fox News Digital.""As I got downstairs, I approached a group of people and I threw my hands up and stated that I am an army medic and they pointed to an individual that was lying in the street. I was only able to locate a single gunshot wound to her lower back.""

After discovering the wound, Lieberman began using his combat medic expertise to treat the victim, including using grocery bags as a makeshift seal. At that point, the gunman returned.""The shooter's vehicle drove past us again, and my roommate yelled at me to get down. I threw myself over the girl while the shooters drove by [and] shot at us again, and then that was when I pulled my weapon out to return fire into the suspect's vehicle.""Lieberman then continued seeing to the young victim's wounds until medical personnel arrived on-scene. The victim survived thanks to the heroic actions of Sgt Lieberman that day.The 22-year-old sergeant was awarded the Solider's Medal on Tuesday at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, for his heroism and selflessness that day.

But Lieberman's humble, sacrificial nature didn't start in the Army. For him, he thanks his upbringing for his call to service.""It all started at home,"" said Lieberman. ""My mom is currently still a nurse and has been for well over 30 years now and my father was a paramedic and a police officer for [a] combined 30 years as well… I just grew up seeing my parents always go above and beyond, always stop[ping] to help someone in need, no matter where they were, what we were doing.""
An Army citation reads, ""Specialist Lieberman’s bravery and willingness to risk his life to protect others is in keeping with the finest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon him, the 82d Airborne Division, and the United States Army.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn truly humble fashion, Lieberman credits others for his brave actions that day. ""I would have not gotten this award if it wasn't for my roommate in that scenario… But if it wasn't for him that day, I would not be in the situation that I am in now,"" said Lieberman. ""I feel like he didn't get much recognition that he deserves and I feel like he should be sitting right here next to me in this interview and in every single interview."" ""Because he brought me my medical bag, he brought me all the rags that I used to clean up her blood… So he might not have pulled the trigger that day, but he 110% was the reason that I was so successful that day in helping that girl.""Fox News Digital's Nick Butler contributed to this report.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/first-ever-american-pope-inspires-faith-leaders-nationwide-heart-integrity","First-ever American pope inspires faith leaders nationwide: 'Heart of integrity'","President Donald Trump told reporters on Thursday afternoon, ""We were a little bit surprised, but very happy. It’s just a great, absolutely great honor."" Pope Leo XIV is the first American pope in the history of the Catholic Church.
Reacting to the election of a new pope on Thursday afternoon, faith leaders from across the country shared thoughts with Fox News Digital about the choice of Cardinal Robert Prevost, who has taken the name Leo XIV.
Jenny Korn, director of the White House's Faith Office, said, ""The White House Faith Office, alongside President [Donald] Trump, are honored that the first American pope was elected to represent 1.5 billion Catholics around the world.""
She added, ""This is a great honor for our country, and we pray that God will impart wisdom upon Pope Leo to successfully lead the Catholic Church.""

Other faith leaders, pastors, authors and those who run organizations focused on Christianity and Catholicism also shared their reaction with Fox News Digital.
Here are the thoughts of eight others.

""The Bible is clear that we need to pray for all of our leaders (1 Timothy 2:1-2),"" said Pastor Jesse Bradley of Grace Community Church of Auburn, Washington.
""We pray that the new pope will shepherd with a heart of integrity, wise decisions and a firm commitment to scripture.""
LIVE UPDATES: CARDINAL ROBERT PREVOST ANNOUNCED AS FIRST AMERICAN POPE, TAKING NAME LEO XIV
""We pray for Pope Leo XIV as he leads people to Jesus around the world and guides many to return to God with all of their hearts,"" he said. ""We also pray for the pope to walk humbly with God, relying on the Holy Spirit daily — and to have great vision, compassion and clarity.""
Bradley also told Fox News Digital, ""In this time of transition, we lift up our eyes to Jesus, the great shepherd of our souls. Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever. Jesus died for our sins and is risen from the grave. He is our living hope."" (See the video just below.)
""May the pope, and all of us, be faithful to God,"" Bradley continued.
""Let’s continue to pray fervently and sincerely during this important time around the world.""
Patti Garibay, founder and executive director of American Heritage Girls, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, told Fox News Digital, ""As the Catholic Church welcomes Pope Leo XIV, I join billions around the world in praying for his wisdom, courage and steadfast commitment to Christ.""
CARDINAL ROBERT PREVOST ANNOUNCED AS FIRST AMERICAN POPE, TAKING NAME LEO XIV
She added, ""May his leadership reflect God’s truth and grace in a world deeply in need of both.""
Jeff King, president of International Christian Concern (ICC), is one of the world's leading experts on religious persecution. He told Fox News Digital, ""I offer heartfelt congratulations on the election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pontiff.
""His experience and global Church engagement equip him to lead courageously as Christians face increased persecution — from North Korea's gulags to the killing fields of Nigeria, where Christians face never-ending attacks by radical Fulani Islamists.""
""I'm excited to see the new pope inspire a renewed commitment to biblical authority and position the Church as a beacon for the oppressed."" (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane)
Said King, ""I'm excited to see the new pope inspire a renewed commitment to biblical authority and position the Church as a beacon for the oppressed. Despite theological differences, evangelicals and Catholics stand united in proclaiming Jesus as ‘the way, the truth, and the life’ (John 14:6).""
He added, ""Together, we must pray for revival across Western Christian communities … I pray with full conviction that the new pope's leadership will guide the Catholic Church to shine as a brilliant light in an increasingly dark world.""
Rev. Samuel Rodriguez of Sacramento, California, told Fox News Digital, ""The election of Pope Leo XIV — the first American pope — marks a watershed moment in the history of the Catholic Church. It is a reminder that faith is for all people in all places and that the gospel is an invitation to all.""
FAITH LEADERS REFLECT ON POPE FRANCIS' DEATH AND LASTING LEGACY FOR CHURCH: ‘MADE HIS MARK’
He added, ""God is moving in America and around the world, and I thank and praise Him for His continued work in our midst.""
""My prayers are with the Catholic Church during this historic transition,"" he also said.
""May she experience a fresh move of God, where the centrality and the finished work of Christ define her mission, where biblical orthodoxy grounds her purpose, and where the preaching of the gospel — filling the Earth with the truth, love, righteousness and justice of Jesus Christ — determines her success.""
Pastor Wendell Vinson, co-founder of CityServe in Bakersfield, California, said, ""I am encouraged by the election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope in history. His heart for missions and his dedication to serving the Lord, no matter the field of service, is inspiring.""

He said as well, ""Across the nation and around the world, people are crying out for the hope and salvation that can only be found through faith in Jesus Christ. I pray that Pope Leo XIV will carry forth that hope and the message of salvation with strength and grace.""
Nick Vujicic, founder and CEO of NickV Ministries based in Texas, told Fox News Digital, ""My hope and prayer is that God will use any faith leader to draw us all closer to the Lord Jesus Christ in a personal walk with Him — a personal walk that reflects a true disciple, where the fruit should show.""
He added, ""I pray for a miracle, that worldwide there would be a spiritual timeout to call all of God’s people into repentance! We have much sin that we must repent of, and that is the only true hope for the world’s problems.""

Archbishop Joseph D’Souza of India shared with Fox News Digital, ""I am pleased the Catholic Church has chosen Cardinal Robert Provost — born in the USA, but who served most of his life in Peru and is a priest from the Augustinian order — to be the new pope of the Catholic Church.""
It was ""extremely encouraging,"" he added, that ""he referred to Pope Francis and suggested that the legacy of his predecessor is safe in his hands. Just as the earlier cardinal from Argentina chose the name of Pope Francis to model his papacy, it is worth noting that Cardinal Provost chose the name of Leo the 14th.

""Pope Leo the 13th, one of the longest serving popes, was known for his commitment and work for justice. Christians around the world need to know that we can address justice issues in the world without becoming ‘woke,’ which generally keeps God out of people’s lives.""
D'Souza noted, ""Even as the media and Americans celebrate the first American-born pope, we must remember that Pope Francis wanted a global pope. And voting cardinals delivered [this] in their vote. The present pope is both American and Peruvian, as he is a naturalized citizen of Peru. Imagine the celebration in Peru and throughout Latin America, with two popes in succession from the Latin world.""
""The prayer of all of God’s people and our church will be with the new pope as he leads in a very difficult time a world that is confronting all kinds of polarization and cultures of hate."" (Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)
He added, ""This is not simply what the Catholic Church needs, but what the world needs — a spiritual leader with the entire world as his parish. The prayer of all of God’s people and our church will be with the new pope as he leads in a very difficult time a world that is confronting all kinds of polarization and cultures of hate.""
Dr. Alex McFarland, a youth, religion and culture expert, as well as the author of 20 books, told Fox News Digital, ""The pageantry, lengthy history, and election process of the papal conclave demonstrate the promise and potential of the new pope’s influence in a fallen world.
""All of Christendom,"" he said, ""should pray for the success of Robert Prevost, now Pope Leo XIV. He undertakes many responsibilities, the most important of which is the teaching of all of God’s Holy Word, the Bible, in a world that desires to ignore or contort portions of it.""
CLICK HERE TO GET TO THE FOX NEWS APP
McFarland added, ""Whether Protestant or Catholic, every believer should lift the new pope in prayer, asking God to strengthen and humble him, give him courage and clarity of thought, and protect him from the pressure to teach what some will want to hear which is contrary to truth. All of Christendom celebrates the newly appointed Bishop of Rome and prays he will be salt and light to fellow believers the world over.""

(Credit: The Associated Press)
A Great Dane the size of a small pony and a Chihuahua the size of a credit card had an adorable world record-setting encounter while meeting for a playdate set up by Guinness World Records.
Reginald, also known as ""Reggie,"" a 7-year-old Great Dane from Idaho, holds the title of tallest dog in the world, standing at 3 feet, 3 inches. Even as a puppy, he towered over full-grown Great Danes at the dog park.
Pearl, a 4-year-old Chihuahua from Florida, secured the record for shortest dog in the world, at just 3.59 inches tall. She can easily fit in the palm of a hand and comes from a long line of small Chihuahuas.

The pair, while an unlikely duo, got along surprisingly well during their two-day visit, according to Pearl's owner, Vanesa Semler.
""For me, [it] was a huge, pleasant surprise from day one because Reggie is like Pearl in [a] bigger size,"" Semler said. ""He is so gentle, so friendly.""

Reggie's owner, Sam Johnson Reiss, said the Great Dane is more of a people person but enjoyed the playdate.
""I would say he was a bit more interested in the people,"" Reiss said. ""He was very cautious, a little anxious, but he was very careful, and he didn't step on her. … He was just very aware that she was there, and she loved him.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/florida-homeowner-finds-98-iguana-eggs-backyard-its-most-weve-ever-removed-from-one-site","Florida homeowner finds 98 iguana eggs in backyard: 'It’s the most we’ve ever removed from one site'","Humane Iguana Control of South Florida discovered a record 98 iguana eggs on a Palmetto private property that were subsequently removed. Iguanas' breeding season lasts from around February through May. (Credit: Humane Iguana Control)
If you thought Florida’s wildest residents were only found on South Beach, think again.
In the sun-soaked suburbs of Palmetto Bay, one Miami homeowner recently discovered she was inadvertently hosting the reptilian version of a baby shower with 98 uninvited guests.
Eventually, she called in the experts at Humane Iguana Control, and what they uncovered was remarkable even by Florida standards.
""We removed 98 eggs,"" Michael Ronquillo, owner of Humane Iguana Control, told Fox News Digital. ""Three female iguanas had nested in burrows that were all interconnected, and each had laid her own clutch.""

In what Humane Iguana Control calls a ""record,"" 98 eggs were discovered and removed from a Miami woman's yard this week. (Courtesy of Humane Iguana Control)
The discovery, made after several inspections and trap setups, turned into what may be a local record.
""It’s the most eggs we’ve ever removed from a single site,"" said Ronquillo. ""We couldn’t find another case of that many being pulled out at once.""
To anyone outside the Sunshine State, it might sound dramatic. But for South Floridians, it’s another day in the life of battling invasive wildlife.
""Iguanas are more than a nuisance,"" Ronquillo said. ""They pose health risks, cause landscape destruction and they dig burrows that can damage infrastructure.""
In one infamous example, an iguana-related burrowing event in West Palm Beach caused $1.8 million in damage after compromising a dam.
""We’ve seen them dig under streets, sidewalks and sea walls,"" he added. ""And if they’re digging in your backyard, you might not know it until the ground collapses under you.""

Beyond property concerns, there’s the sanitation issue.
""They’ll defecate around pools, schools, playgrounds. It’s a health hazard,"" said Ronquillo. ""We get calls from schools where kids are playing under trees, and the iguanas are just up there … going to the bathroom. Constantly.""
Iguanas laying that many eggs isn't just wild, it's efficient.
""There’s a 93% hatch rate for iguana eggs,"" Ronquillo said. ""If the client hadn’t called us, that entire neighborhood would’ve had a serious problem in just a few months.""
The reason this yard became an iguana maternity ward? Prime real estate.
""They’ll test a bunch of spots,"" he explained. ""If the ground’s too hard or too hot, they’ll move on. But this spot — soft soil, some shade, near water — was perfect. So, they all locked onto it.""
As a homeowner discovering iguanas on site, what you don’t do in this situation matters even more.
""The worst thing people can do is cover up the holes,"" said Ronquillo. ""We tell our clients to flag the burrows, use a little irrigation flag or something visible, and call a professional. When the holes are covered, it compacts the soil and makes it harder for us to dig the right path and remove the eggs.""
Ronquillo’s team uses cameras and hand-digging to trace iguana tunnels.
""It’s not just digging a hole and pulling something out,"" he said. ""You have to understand how they move and build their burrows.""
Breeding season typically runs from February to May, though Ronquillo cautions that surprises aren’t uncommon.
""We’ve seen baby iguanas in July, August, even September,"" he said. ""So, while it’s more common in spring, it can technically happen all year.""
Iguanas aren’t native to Florida, they’re invasive and their presence traces back to the 1960s.

""The iguanas originally arrived through the pet trade market and cargo ships,"" said Ronquillo. ""They’d float over on lumber after hurricanes or be released by owners who couldn’t care for them.""
Florida’s warm climate, abundant food sources and lack of natural predators created the perfect conditions for them to thrive and multiply.
""They eat native bird eggs, destroy landscaping and dig burrows that damage roads, sidewalks and even dams,"" Ronquillo explained. Their impact has been so severe that Florida classifies them a public nuisance and encourages humane removal efforts.
If you spot digging, don’t break out the shovel or worse.
""Don’t try to remove it yourself, and definitely don’t put poison in the holes,"" Ronquillo said. ""Just flag it, and call a licensed removal company.""
These reptiles also come with built-in defense mechanisms, so don't try this at home.
""They have very sharp claws and teeth, and their tails can whip at up to 30 miles an hour,"" Ronquillo explained. ""If you’re not experienced, you could end up in the ER. We’ve had clients try to grab one and end up with serious injuries.""

This Miami homeowner made one call and prevented nearly 100 invasive reptiles from joining the neighborhood.
""This client helped stop a whole new infestation,"" said Ronquillo. ""If more people act that quickly, we can really make a difference.""
Ronquillo’s final note: It's not just about one backyard.
""If everybody does their part,"" he said, ""we can protect our environment and our neighborhoods. Just like this client did. It really makes a difference.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/gone-wind-found-bros-beloved-missing-dog-shows-up-frat-house-5-years-later","Gone with the wind, found with the bros: Beloved missing dog shows up at frat house 5 years later","Kingston, an 11-year-old Yorkie lost for five years, was reunited with his owner by Kappa Sigma brothers at the University of Southern Mississippi after the dog showed up on their porch. (Credit: Ashton Klink)
Five years ago, as Hurricane Laura tore through Lake Charles, Louisiana, a 6-pound Yorkshire terrier named Kingston disappeared into the storm. But this isn't your average lost dog story.
His owner, Debbie LaFleur, searched desperately, fearing the worst. Then, out of nowhere and half a decade later, he turned up somewhere no one expected — not in a shelter, not with a neighbor, but on the back porch of a college fraternity.
""I never thought I’d see him again,"" LaFleur told KBTX. ""Never.""
ANGIE HARMON WAS 'SAVED' IN UNEXPECTED WAY AFTER DELIVERY DRIVER KILLED HER DOG
In early April, Kingston, now 11 years old, was discovered lounging casually on the back steps of the Kappa Sigma house at the University of Southern Mississippi, wearing a red T-shirt like he’d just gotten back from tailgating.
""There’s just this Yorkie sitting there in a red T-shirt,"" fraternity President Neal Rachal told CNN, still sounding a bit bewildered.

The dog was discovered by fraternity brothers and later reunited with his original owner in Louisiana. (Ashton Klink)
Naturally, the brothers took him in, named him ""Benji"" and treated him like one of their own. He had a full run of the house, shared their snacks and blended into the chaos better than some pledges.
""He’s like a member of the chapter right now,"" Rachal told KBTX. ""He’s done everything with us for the past week.""
But it didn’t take long for curiosity to take over. One of the brothers brought the mystery pup to get his microchip scanned. That’s when the truth came out. ""Benji"" was actually Kingston, and he was reported missing five years earlier in Lake Charles.

In a photo provided by Ashton Klink, Kingston, a Yorkshire terrier missing since 2020, relaxes outside the Kappa Sigma house in Hattiesburg, Miss., before being identified by a microchip and returned to his family.  (Ashton Klink)
""Years ago, Debbie had Kingston microchipped at University Animal Clinic in Lake Charles,"" Dr. Sarah Guidry told KPLC. ""That’s how a fraternity at the University of Southern Mississippi identified the pup. It worked great. Five years later, they found the dog, and it was still registered to the correct owner.""
Once the microchip gave them LaFleur’s info, the brothers emailed her.
Back in Louisiana, Debbie was at work when the message popped up.
""My heart started pounding,"" she told KPLC. ""Before I could call him, he called me. I told my boss, ‘I found Kingston! I found Kingston!’ And we both just started yelling and screaming.""
She and her son Jared wasted no time, hopping in the car and making the four-hour drive to Hattiesburg to get their pup. When they arrived, Kingston wasted no time either. He bolted toward Debbie, ears perked up like a tiny, fuzzy missile.
""We’ve never seen Benji run like that,"" Rachal said, laughing in an interview with KPLC.

It was a joyful reunion and an emotional one. Debbie told KBTX the moment was bittersweet because Kingston had belonged to both her and her late husband, who died in 2022.
""This was our dog,"" she said. ""He’s probably the one that made this happen.""
The Kappa Sigma brothers, for their part, were happy to play a role in the reunion and rather proud of their temporary house guest. Debbie praised them as ""wonderful, wonderful guys"" for taking Kingston in and doing the right thing.
""I’m so happy to have my baby back,"" she told KBTX.

It also says something about Yorkies. These little guys are tougher than they look. Kingston had apparently spent years dodging storms, traffic and whatever else the Gulf Coast threw his way, only to find a safe haven 300 miles away from Lake Charles on the porch of a bunch of college kids.
And just to keep things interesting, Kingston wasn’t quite done adventuring. Just days after making it home to Lake Charles, he pulled one last stunt, slipping away during a walk in the park.
This time, he recovered within an hour thanks to the help of a local reporter.
""Thank you so much, Brendan Brown, for all your help!"" Debbie told KPLC, laughing. ""It didn’t take us five years this time.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/remains-domestic-cats-found-wreckage-ancient-ship-likely-first-arrive-united-states","Remains of domestic cats found in wreckage of ancient ship were likely first to arrive in United States","ASPCA Senior Behavior Manager Adi Hovav joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to explain the benefits of adopting kittens.
Cats have lived alongside humans for thousands of years, and the remains of two domestic felines found in a nearly 500-year-old Spanish shipwreck likely represent the earliest example of the animal in what is now the United States, according to a new study.
""Cats accompanied sailors on ships where they were relied on to hunt rats and mice that were infesting ships’ holds,"" researchers wrote in a study published in American Antiquity last month.
The Emanuel Point II, a Spanish conquistador ship, wrecked in Florida’s Pensacola Bay in 1559 during a hurricane.
The shipwreck was discovered in 2006, and the researchers said the remains of an adult and juvenile cat were found in the wreckage.

""Cats have received limited archaeological attention because their independence limits direct insight into human societies,"" the researchers said.
The study said that analyses of the two cats and other historical cat remains show the pets ranged dramatically in size from normal house cats to much smaller.
The researchers wrote that, based on a chemical analysis of the remains, the adult cat doesn’t seem to have relied on rats for food and mainly ate a diet of fish and possibly domestic meat.
""These pests were unintentionally introduced to the New World, and cats would have followed, hunting both native and invasive pests,"" the study said of rats.
Cats have long accompanied sailors on ships.  (Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)
Within the U.S., early cat remains have also been found in the colonial settlements in St. Augustine, Florida, and the British colony of Jamestown in Virginia and were possibly aboard the Mayflower.
LOST CAT MAKES 900-MILE JOURNEY BACK HOME TO CALIFORNIA FROM YELLOWSTONE
Cats aren’t native to the U.S. and are believed to have originated in the Middle East before they were brought to the Americas by Europeans. They were likely introduced to Europe for pest control, the scientists said.
The researchers said they weren’t sure if the cats on the Emanuel Point II were brought on board intentionally, but study co-author John Bratten, an anthropologist at the University of West Florida, told Live Science the cats apparently ate a similar diet to the sailors, which showed that they were fed either because there weren’t enough rats or out of kindness.

""It was interesting to think about the idea of the cat being a pet or one that was looked after by the Spanish sailors,"" Bratten told Live Science.

The study said, ""That cats were on board [the Emanuel Point II] suggests their primary role may have been as commensal ratters and mousers that kept the onboard rodent population in check. This does not, however, preclude the possibility that these cats were well liked and cared for by the sailors.""
Cats were also considered lucky by sailors, the researchers added.
Today, one in three U.S. households has a pet cat.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/faith-leaders-reflect-pope-francis-death-legacy-church-made-mark","Faith leaders reflect on Pope Francis' death and lasting legacy for church: 'Made his mark'","Catholic Connection radio show host Teresa Tomeo describes the emotional reaction to Pope Francis' procession moving his casket to St. Peter's Basilica.
Faith leaders from across the country have shared reaction and insight with Fox News Digital as the world continues to mourn the loss of Pope Francis, who died at age 88 on Monday, April 21.
Francis served for 12 years as pontiff. He was the first Jesuit to serve as pope of the Roman Catholic Church. His funeral is scheduled for Saturday, April 26.
Alex McFarland, Ph.D., youth, religion and culture expert as well as the author of more than 20 books, told Fox News Digital on Monday, ""Christians everywhere, regardless of affiliation, should extend loving condolences and prayers for Catholic believers who are mourning the loss of Pope Francis. Belief in the Triune God and in Christ, the Son, unites us (I John 5:1), along with so many other core truths of the Christian faith. Let us unite in prayer for the Catholic Church to be clearly led at this time by God’s Holy Spirit and His Word.""
5 WAYS POPE FRANCIS IMPACTED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
McFarland is director of worldview for Charis Bible College in Woodland Park, Colorado, and co-hosts the ""Truth and Liberty"" TV broadcast. He's heard live daily on 200-plus stations of the American Family Radio Network.
Rev. Samuel Rodriguez of Sacramento, California, commented, ""We mourn the passing of Pope Francis, a visionary leader of faith and a tireless advocate for the marginalized. His life was a testament to hope — the hope that the Church can shine as a beacon of light in a darkening world. Now, more than ever, that message is needed. We have lost one of its most steadfast champions.""

Other faith leaders shared their insights with Fox News Digital as well.
Pastor Wendell Vinson, co-founder of CityServe and based in Bakersfield, California, said, ""We join with the Catholic Church and people of faith across the globe in mourning the death of Pope Francis. A man known for his humility and care for the least of these, his life is a shining example of service to those the world has often overlooked.
""This same spirit characterized his work on behalf of the persecuted and oppressed around the world.""
POPE FRANCIS' DEATH AFTER RESPIRATORY ILLNESS: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BILATERIAL PNEUMONIA
He added, ""Pope Francis’ legacy reminds us of the critical importance of cooperation between faith groups and that more good can be accomplished when we work together.""
Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, told Fox News Digital, ""Catholics around the globe are mourning the death of Pope Francis. He touched millions of the faithful, including non-Catholics and non-believers. When Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio assumed the role of Pope Francis, his down-to-earth style captured the plaudits of Catholics and non-Catholics alike. It was his unscripted, and often spontaneous, manner of speaking that made him so authentic and appealing.""
""No one criticized him for not speaking from the heart.""
Added Donohue, ""It also got him into trouble, especially when speaking to reporters aboard the papal plane following a trip overseas. On many occasions, following a chat with journalists, the Vatican press corps had to clarify what he meant. But no one criticized him for not speaking from the heart.""
He went on, ""Unfortunately, the end of his pontificate was troubling. His approval of a Vatican document that allows priests to bless same-sex couples was met with widespread criticism. Indeed, it was so divisive that it seriously undid much of the goodwill he previously earned … For the most part, the media treated Francis with kindness.""
Donohue also said, ""The pope’s strong defense of the rights of the unborn, and his condemnation of gender ideology, sat well with conservative Catholics. But they were not happy when he refused to honor questions regarding his apostolic exhortation, ‘Amoris Laetitia’; prominent prelates sought clarification on some doctrinal issues.
""The Holy Father was clearly more critical of conservative bishops than he was their liberal counterparts.""

He added, ""Even more significant, his attack on traditionalists, especially those who favor the Latin Mass, were frequent and lacking in nuance.""
Donohue also noted that ""Pope Francis made his mark on the Church, much as John Paul II and Benedict XVI did. It remains to be seen whether his successor will hew more closely to his stance than that of his predecessors. May he rest in peace.""
Pastor Jesse Bradley of Grace Community Church outside Seattle, Washington, commented, ""The Bible is clear that we need to pray for our leaders. We can pray for Pope Francis, for his soul. There is no greater goal than to hear, ‘Well done, my good and faithful servant’ from Jesus. God has called all of us to shine His light in a dark world.""

Bradley added, ""Pope Francis had an appreciation for creation and a heart of compassion. His leadership included prayers during the pandemic even when Saint Peter’s Square was empty. His passing comes the day after Easter, which is a clear reminder that Jesus is the resurrection and the life. Death is not the end of the story — because Jesus is victorious and the grave is empty.""
He also said, ""The invitation from our Lord is for everyone. If the pope had a message today, it would be that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life — and no one comes to the Father except through Him (John 14:6) and John 3:16, ‘For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, so that whoever believes in him will not perish, but have eternal life.’""

Bradley continued, ""The pope dedicated his life in service to God, and we can turn to Jesus now with all of our hearts. There’s no greater decision than to follow Jesus both daily and eternally. Grace is an undeserved gift, heaven is real, and Jesus died for our sins. During this time of grieving, may we be comforted by these everlasting truths and indestructible hope.""
Jeff King, president of International Christian Concern (ICC) and a leading expert on religious persecution around the world, shared, ""As an evangelical leader, I reflect on Pope Francis’ passing with gratitude for his service and heart for the poor. His leadership inspires us to call for a renewed commitment in the Catholic Church to the Bible’s authority as the guide for faith and practice.""
King added, ""Despite our theological differences, evangelicals and Catholics stand united in proclaiming Jesus Christ as the world’s only hope. As the Catholic Church navigates this transition, we pray for revival and a shared devotion to lifting up Jesus as the way, truth and life.""
King is also the author of ""The Whisper,"" a 30-day devotional that reveals spiritual lessons ""from the prisons of the persecuted.""
Archbishop Timothy P. Broglio, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, issued a statement that said in part, ""Pope Francis will long be remembered for his outreach to those on the margins of the Church and of society. He renewed for us the mission to bring the Gospel out to the ends of the earth and offer divine mercy to all.
""He has also taken advantage of the present Jubilee to call us to a profound hope — one that is not an empty or naïve hope, but one grounded in the promise of Almighty God to be with us always.""
Archbishop Joseph D’Souza, based in India, told Fox News Digital, ""Pope Francis was a voice for unity and understanding among all faith groups amid increasing polarization, and I join the Catholic Church as they grieve his death. His legacy reminds us that ministry must not be limited to those who belong to our faith or those who agree with us. It must be for all people.""
""Many will rush to make an assessment of his legacy, but this is premature, if not injurious. After all, we are still assessing past pontificates — never mind the broader legacy of Vatican II."" (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)
""Pope Francis championed the dignity of all humankind, regardless of their social standing or faith tradition. His dream was for the church to become a field hospital — and it is our responsibility to see that dream realized for the good of humanity. Throughout his papacy, Pope Francis embodied the humility and courageous care for the least of these, carrying on the great tradition of his namesake, St. Francis of Assisi.""
In an original op-ed for Fox News Digital, Rev. Robert Sirico wrote, ""If there is any one thing that can be agreed upon by all parties about Pope Francis’ pontificate, it is that it was disruptive and ambiguous on several levels. Many will rush to make an assessment of his legacy, but this is premature, if not injurious.
""After all, we are still assessing past pontificates — never mind the broader legacy of Vatican II — and their implications for the life of the Church.""

He added, in part, ""As the first pope from the Americas — though of Italian immigrant parentage — his election was historic. While improbable, it is not entirely inconceivable the next conclave could result in the first African pope since ancient times, especially considering the Church’s dynamic growth on the continent.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/chicago-food-blogger-stunned-heinous-online-antisemitism","Chicago food blogger stunned by 'heinous' online antisemitism","The ""Babka King"" tells Fox News Digital that, while most of the comments he gets are positive, when he gets negative comments, they're mostly on videos about Jewish food.
Chicago food blogger Chris Campbell, known online as Chris CARESNONE or the ""Babka King,"" wanted to bring the world together through cuisine — but now he’s speaking out against hate.
On April 9, Campbell posted a video discussing the antisemitic comments he had seen on content featuring Jewish food. In the video, he shows that someone commented accusing him of taking money from various Israeli lobbyists and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which he mocked.
""The antisemitism that I have noticed, and I have personally felt — I have gotten death threats… it is real and you can see it,"" Campbell said in the video posted to his Instagram page. Campbell, who is known for tasting food from around the world, noted that he has tried cuisine from India, Italy, Greece, Mexico and Russia, among others, but none of them received as much ""hate"" as videos featuring Jewish food.

GLOBAL RISE IN ANTISEMITISM LEAVES JEWISH COMMUNITY ISOLATED, RABBI SAYS WORLD AT 'A TIPPING POINT'
When speaking to Fox News Digital, Campbell emphasized that it wasn’t as though the comment sections of his Jewish content were full of hate and antisemitism, but rather that it’s the kind of content that gets the most negative attention. However, he did talk about the death threats that he said were full of ""the most heinous things I’ve ever heard.""
""The facts are I have received death threats when I've tried babka, which is wild,"" Campbell told Fox News Digital.
After posting the video in which he called out the antisemitic comments, Campbell shared another video of himself tasting a Palestinian dish called knafeh. However, he said that while he ""got some interesting comments"" on the video, it ""still pales in comparison to what I've gotten for the Jewish culture.""

ANTISEMITIC INCIDENTS BREAK RECORD FOR 4TH STRAIGHT YEAR, ADL FINDS
Campbell admitted to Fox News Digital that the comments initially made him wonder if trying Jewish food was putting his life in jeopardy. However, after giving it some thought, he decided to use his platform to spread more love and ultimately doubled down on his Jewish food tastings.
""[There are] people literally in my DMs saying how much they're, like, scared,"" Campbell said. ""And what kind of person would I be if I have a platform and I see what I see and I don't say nothing?""

Campbell's journey to becoming the ""Babka King"" started with a package from Half Moon Rondout Café in Kingston, New York.
""I had never even heard of babka, I didn't even know they were sending me anything,"" Campbell told Fox News Digital. ""I opened the box and I got this waft of, like, cinnamon and sugar, and it hit me in the face. I'm like, this is crazy.""
Half Moon Rondout Café owner J.T. Pinna — whose background is in human rights — told Fox News Digital that Campbell ""has a PhD in babka"" now that he has tried so many. Pinna said he liked Campbell's content and decided to send the content creator a babka to see what would happen, and it turned into a sensation.
He told Fox News Digital that the first babka tasting led to a flood of packages of Jewish food. Since then, Campbell has tried several babkas as well as other Jewish treats, like hamantaschen and pastrami sandwiches.
Campbell is not one for picking sides — not even when it comes to cinnamon versus chocolate babka. Rather, he aims to entice others to expand their palates and learn about different cultures through food.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/family-friendly-golf-course-puts-cheating-couple-blast-over-parking-lot-affair-not-jerry-springer","Family-friendly golf course puts cheating couple on blast over parking lot affair: Not ‘Jerry Springer'","President Donald Trump gave his rooting interest for the Masters to Fox News Digital while aboard Air Force One on Friday.
Of all the hazards a golf course might face, a parking lot affair by the recycling bin wasn't exactly on the scorecard for Skylinks at Buchanan Fields in California.
For the business, a public 9-hole course in East Bay, the biggest drama of the season hasn’t come from a bunker or a blown putt. It has come from two parked cars in the far corner of the lot, where an alleged weekly rendezvous has transformed a family-friendly fairway into the site of a full-blown soap opera.
A spicy Instagram post from the course lit up social media last week with this opening line:""To the late 30’s married wife in the black car who’s having a secret affair and with the guy in the smaller silver car who’ve decided to using (sic) the back right corner of our Skylinks carpark to meet weekly... PLEASE STOP.""WOMAN RANTS ABOUT CHICKEN DINNER UPROAR WITH BOYFRIEND, IGNITING SOCIAL MEDIA DEBATE
Skylinks Golf posted this message to Instagram in April 2025, publicly calling out a suspected affair occurring weekly in the back of its parking lot. (@skylinksgolf via Instagram)
That blunt PSA, posted without names but full of implication, quickly went viral, racking up shares, memes, and speculation from curious commenters and suspicious spouses across the Bay Area and beyond.""We’re a family golf course — not some Jerry Springer family destruction zone,"" the post concluded, before warning: ""If it happens again, we’ll drop the footage and watch all hell break loose.""
In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, one of the golf course’s four owners, a New Zealand native who goes simply by ""Kiwi,"" confirmed the post was very real, the footage does exist, and no, this is not a marketing stunt.""We’re a small, community course in Concord — not a drive-thru hookup spot for cheaters,"" Kiwi said, deadpan. ""This isn’t the kind of hole-in-one we encourage.""
According to Kiwi, staff began noticing the pattern about two months ago with the same cars, the same day of the week, and the same far corner of the lot, which sees basically zero legitimate golf traffic.FALSE ALARM, REAL HEAT: FIREFIGHTERS SURPRISE CROWD OF ROMANCE NOVEL FANS""You don’t park way in the back to go play a quick round,"" Kiwi said. ""There’s no reason to be near the recycling bin unless you're dropping off cardboard… or something else.""
The maintenance crew, which starts work around 5 a.m., would routinely spot the black car and silver car pulling in one after the other.""One of our guys finally said, ‘Here they go again — early bird smash session in the car park,’ and after that we couldn’t un-hear it.""
It became a running joke, until it wasn’t.
""It’s a family space. I’ve got two daughters. We’ve got kids playing under the pomegranate tree 20 feet from where this was happening. At a certain point, it’s just gross. Like — go to the hotel across the street. It’s 100 yards away, and it has doors.""
Once Skylinks posted the PSA, things got even messier. The post went viral, and the DMs flooded in.""We started getting messages from people saying, ‘Hey, I think I know who this is. Send me the footage.’ Like, no! That’s not what we’re doing here,"" Kiwi said. ""We’re not here to destroy people’s lives. We just want them to stop using our parking lot like it’s a poorly disguised drive-in.""
One man even contacted the course because his wife drives a black car and he ""just wanted to be sure.""
The sun rises over Skylinks at Buchanan Fields in Concord, Calif., a public course that recently went viral after its owner warned alleged cheaters to stay off the lot. (@skylinksgolf via Instagram)
""That’s when I knew this thing had really blown up,"" Kiwi laughed.
Despite all the attention, Kiwi says the footage will stay locked up — for now. ""We’ve got the footage, and yes, it’s very clear what’s going on. But no, we’re not releasing it. This is still a family business, not an episode of Dateline.""
Still, the viral fame has brought new attention to Skylinks, a public course with a comeback story of its own. Once nearly shut down, the course was revived by Kiwi after he bought it a little over a year ago. Since then, he’s tripled business and turned it into a thriving community hub, he said.""We think of ourselves as a community club, not a country club,"" Kiwi said. ""It’s full of people just learning to play, local families, and folks grabbing lunch and hitting a bucket of balls.""

Kiwi, originally from New Zealand and married to an American, personally learned how to golf at Skylinks and fell in love with the course before buying it.
Though the tone of the post was cheeky, their message is serious. While Skylinks has seen some curious newcomers trying to park near the now-infamous dumpster for a photo op, Kiwi is hoping the viral attention fades and the back lot goes back to being empty.And to those still tempted to turn a 9-hole golf course into a lovers’ lane?
Kiwi has one piece of advice to the public: ""Keep your hole-in-ones on the course, not in our car park.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBut to the couple specifically, Kiwi had a little something extra.""I now know who you are. I don’t know why you picked our parking lot. But what I do know is I have a very particular set of footage—footage we've gathered over months of running this golf course. Footage that will make me a nightmare for cheaters like you.""""If you check into the hotel 100 yards away and keep it off my property, that’ll be the end of it. I won’t look for you, I won’t pursue you. But if you do return to the car park dumpster one more time, I'll release the footage — and it's game over. Good luck.""
Kiwi’s channeling of the movie ""Taken"" might be tongue-in-cheek, but the message is dead serious: Hook up somewhere else.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/5-ways-pope-francis-impacted-catholic-church","5 ways Pope Francis impacted the Catholic Church","The Vatican says Pope Francis has passed away the day after meeting VP Vance on Easter.
Pope Francis was elected to the papacy on March 13, 2013, at the age of 76. He passed away at the age of 88 on Monday, April 21.
Born in Argentina as Jorge Bergoglio, Pope Francis joined the Society of Jesus at the age of 21. He was ordained a priest days before his 33rd birthday and was consecrated as an auxiliary bishop of his hometown of Buenos Aires in 1992.
In 1998, he was named the Archbishop of Buenos Aires, serving in that role until his election to the papacy in 2013. He was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 2001 by Pope John Paul II, whom he would later canonize.
PHOTO GALLERY: POPE FRANCIS THROUGH THE YEARS
Here are five ways the pope impacted the Catholic Church.
Pope Francis was the first Jesuit to be elected pope.

Francis' election marked many other firsts. A native of Argentina, he was the first pope to be elected from the Americas and the first from the Southern Hemisphere.
He was also the first pope to adopt the regnal name ""Francis.""
""For many Jesuits, what the first Jesuit pope meant was someone who could show the world what the Jesuits are really about, beyond the stereotypes,"" Fr. David Paternostro, S.J., a Jesuit priest who lives in Missouri, told Fox News Digital.
""Francis is a man who has felt Jesus close to him in spite of his sins and wants others to have this same feeling.""
Paternostro continued, ""From his very first interview, where he answered the question, 'Who is Jorge Mario Bergoglio?' by declaring, 'I am a sinner,' he demonstrated a hallmark of Jesuit spirituality: a sense of being a sinner loved by the Lord and called to friendship with Jesus.""
WHAT IS THE PAPAL ENCLAVE? INSIDE THE ANCIENT PROCESS OF CHOOSING THE NEXT POPE
Pope Francis, Paternostro said, ""showed the world what Jesuits can be at our best: a true evangelist, a true son of Ignatius and (as he has described himself repeatedly) a true son of the Church.""
""Francis is a man who has felt Jesus close to him in spite of his sins and [wanted] others to have this same feeling,"" Paternostro said.
Throughout the 12 years of his papacy, Pope Francis canonized nearly 1,000 people. (This total, however, includes the ""Martyrs of Otranto,"" a group of 813 people who were killed on Aug. 14, 1480, in Otranto, Italy.)
Among the notable people canonized by Pope Francis was St. Junipero Serra, a Spanish priest who established nine missions in what is now California.

This was the first canonization on U.S. soil.  (John McDonnell/The Washington Post via Getty Images)
Serra's canonization on Sept. 23, 2015 was the first-ever on U.S. soil, Fox News Digital previously reported.
Francis also canonized Pope John Paul II, Mother Teresa, Pope Paul VI and Pope John XXIII.
On Aug. 2, 2018, Pope Francis issued a letter revising the Catechism of the Catholic Church's teaching on the death penalty.
MOTHER TERESA'S LAST MESSAGE, WRITTEN ON DAY SHE DIED, REVEALS DEEP FAITH IN CHRIST
""Pope Francis continued the recent tradition of previous popes, including from St. John Paul II, by escalating Catholic opposition to modern-day use of the death penalty,"" Charles Camosy, professor of bioethics at the Creighton University School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital.
Francis' language in the letter, however, ""stopped short of calling the practice intrinsically evil, a term used frequently in Catholic moral theology,"" Camosy said.
Pope Francis called the death penalty ""inadmissible.""  (AP)
Instead, Francis used the term ""inadmissible"" and said it was an attack on human dignity.
""I think it is fair to say that the Holy Father used the strongest possible language against the death penalty without using language that would 100% close the door on it no matter what,"" Camosy said.
Italy was one of the hardest-hit areas in the first months of the coronavirus pandemic and saw thousands of deaths. The entire country went into lockdown on March 9, the first to do so.
About two weeks later, on March 27, 2020, in one of the most striking moments of his papacy, Pope Francis delivered a special ""Urbi et Orbi"" (""from the city to the world"") blessing from St. Peter's Square, which was televised worldwide.

For Dawn Eden Goldstein, a Washington, D.C.-based theologian and canon lawyer, the moment had special meaning.

""I have never been so proud to be a Catholic as when Pope Francis gave his extraordinary blessing to the world from a near-empty St. Peter's Square on March 27, 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when half the world was under lockdown,"" she said.
She continued, ""His message was powerful: He encouraged us to treat the crisis as an opportunity for personal conversion and for building fraternity, and he assured us that Jesus was with us.""

After the blessing, Pope Francis lifted the Eucharist, contained in a special receptacle called a monstrance, and took it out of St. Peter's Basilica.
Visibly limping, Pope Francis then blessed the world.
""He gave us all a moment of profound intimacy with the Lord at the time when we needed it most,"" Goldstein said.
The word ""Catholic"" translates to ""universal,"" and Pope Francis' papacy exemplified this. Francis visited places no previous pontiff had ever visited and appointed cardinals from non-traditional locations.
During his papacy, Pope Francis became the first pope to visit Iraq, Mongolia, Myanmar and the United Arab Emirates.

An aggressive sea lion sent surfers running this week after it repeatedly went after them, even coming onto the beach, video of the incident showed.
The sea lion was suffering from severe domoic acid, which is caused by an unprecedented toxic algae bloom in the area that affects the animals’ brains, causing them to be more aggressive, experts said, FOX 11 reported.
It has affected thousands of sea lions and other sea life in the area, killing more dolphins than in years past and at least two whales.

""These domoic acid events are getting bigger and worse and more frequent,"" John Warner, CEO of Marine Mammal Care Center, told the station. ""That's horrifying. How long can all of these species take this type of abuse and still be with us? That's the question, and I don't know the answer to that.""
Aside from domoic acid, the toxic algae bloom also sickens sea life with Saxitoxin, which causes paralytic shellfish poisoning.

Franklin Graham offers a message of hope, healing, and redemption—and explains how Samaritan’s Purse is helping families rebuild. (Credit: Billy Graham Evangelistic Association)
In a powerful Easter message filmed from the smoldering remains of fire-ravaged neighborhoods in California, Rev. Franklin Graham is calling the nation to remember that even in devastation, hope is not lost.
Filmed in the ashes of homes lost to the Southern California wildfires, ""Easter from the Ashes"" premieres at noon ET Sunday on Fox News.
""Can there be hope in the place of ashes?"" Graham asks in the special, standing amid the rubble of the Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles. ""This is a message of hope for people who feel forgotten.""
The program, which also features performances by Grammy-winning worship leader Michael W. Smith and artist Charity Gayle, was recorded in and around areas still scarred by flames.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HOSTS EASTER DINNER WITH 'WORSHIP AND PRAYERS'
The music portion was filmed on the campus of Pepperdine University, just miles from neighborhoods that were leveled.
The broadcast is the latest in a long tradition of Easter messages from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, but this one is grounded quite literally in the ashes of loss — speaking not only to spiritual need, but also to physical and emotional pain felt across the country in the wake of natural disasters.

In just the last several months, Americans have endured a string of catastrophes: wildfires on the West Coast, floods and tornadoes across the Midwest and South, and Hurricane Helene in the Southeast. In each case, Samaritan’s Purse — the international relief organization led by Graham — has mobilized to help.
""Easter is not the same for many people this year,"" Graham told Fox News Digital. ""So many have gone through devastating tragedy and loss. But I want people to know that God hasn’t abandoned them.""
Samaritan’s Purse has deployed disaster relief teams across the U.S. to provide everything from physical labor to moral support.
TRUMP HOSTS FAITH LEADERS FOR EASTER PRAYER DINNER, SLAMS EFFORT TO RID AMERICA OF CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES
In California, volunteers have been helping families sift through ashes to recover treasured belongings. In one especially memorable case, a woman was searching for a porcelain vase — her grandmother’s heirloom brought from overseas. The team found it unbroken, tucked in a basement corner under piles of ash.
""It wasn’t cracked. It wasn’t chipped,"" Graham said. ""To anyone else, it was just a vase. But to her, it was priceless. That’s the kind of healing we’re trying to bring.""
In other parts of the country, Samaritan’s Purse has helped restore mobility and shelter by replacing cars and rebuilding homes. Partnering with Rick Hendrick of Hendrick Automotive Group, the organization has been supplying vehicles to families who lost everything.
""When people lose their cars in a disaster, they’re stuck,"" Graham said. ""We’ve seen people walking to the store or relying on neighbors. We just felt called to help however we could.""
Currently, Samaritan’s Purse has more than a dozen homes under construction, with plans to continue rebuilding for at least the next three years.
While physical rebuilding is vital, Graham’s Easter message centers on spiritual renewal through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. He draws attention to the biblical reality of both heaven and hell — a theme often overlooked, but one Graham said he believes is urgently needed today.
""In this special, I talk about how Jesus preached on hell. And how He also gave us a way out,"" Graham said. ""He died for our sins. He was buried. And on the third day, He rose again. That’s the hope we have.""

He recounted stories from disaster survivors who described their experiences as near-death or even miraculous. One woman, caught in a flood, managed to grab a branch that later couldn’t be found —something she believes was divine intervention.
""Some people say angels saved them,"" Graham noted. ""Things happened that just don’t make sense otherwise.""
Graham also spoke about his recent visit to the White House during Holy Week, where he joined around 40 pastors for a private dinner and worship service with President Donald Trump. He described the President’s remarks as ""the clearest gospel message I’ve ever heard from a U.S. president.""
""I don’t think we’ve heard anything like it since maybe George Washington,"" Graham said. ""He not only believes, but he’s not afraid to say it.""
""We have a president that is not afraid of his faith,"" Graham said Friday on The Ingraham Angle. ""He doesn’t shy away from it. He’s very bold about it and clear about what he believes.""
Graham described Trump’s message at the dinner as one of the clearest public affirmations of the Gospel he has heard from any U.S. president. ""He talks about Jesus Christ, talks about his own faith,"" he said. ""He’ll tell you that when that bullet went through his ear in Butler, Pennsylvania, it was God who spared his life.""

The day after the dinner, Graham participated in a service for White House staff, including lawyers and administrative professionals, joined by Pastor Greg Laurie and Pastor Jentezen Franklin, who administered communion. ""It was a wonderful time of worship,"" he recalled.
Graham credited the Trump administration with helping cut through bureaucratic red tape that often slows recovery efforts in disaster zones.
""California has been very difficult,"" he said. ""We’ve faced a lot of delays at the state and local level. But the President pushed FEMA to act faster. That helped open doors.""

As the interview closed, Graham returned to the core message of the season.
""Easter is a very special time because Jesus Christ conquered death,"" he said. ""He took our sins to the cross. He died. He was buried. But on the third day, He rose from the dead. And He will come into any heart that is willing to accept Him by faith. That’s the miracle of Easter.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/short-questions-dana-perino-her-new-book","Short questions for Dana Perino about her new book","'America’s Newsroom’ anchor Dana Perino announces new book ‘I Wish Someone Had Told Me’ to release in April.
Dana Perino answers questions about her new book, ""I Wish Someone Had Told Me … The Best Advice for Building a Great Career and a Meaningful Life.""
When my mom finished reading ""Everything Will Be Okay — Life Lessons for Young Women from a Former Young Woman,"" she called me and said, ""Wow, I wish someone had told me all of this.""
She started working in the mid-1960s, when women were really coming into the workforce in droves. They paved the way for so many of us, and now we have lots of different avenues we can take in our careers. (Thank you, ladies! We appreciate all you did for us.)

I’ve found that since I left the White House and started mentoring younger people that the questions don’t change that much — but the hunger for more advice and guidance continues to grow. So I decided to refresh my advice in a post-COVID and pre-AI world, and to gather the best advice from the most wonderful group of advisors and mentors I could put together in one book.
Fox News' Dana Perino answers questions for Fox News Digital about her new book, out April 2025 from Fox News Books.  (Fox News)
""I Wish Someone Had Told Me"" is an updated version of the advice that I’ve gathered based on experience, and includes interviews with over 40 of my friends, loved ones and colleagues — including my husband, Peter McMahon, my college roommate, Andrea Aragon, and country music star Dierks Bentley, as well as many of my Fox News colleagues.
They were very generous with their time, and their suggestions are terrific. There’s so much wisdom in their answers to my questions; it opened my eyes to the hard-earned success of the people around me every day. The chapters span the questions of how to decide what you want to do in your career, tried and true ways to get the promotions you want, managing the elusive work-life balance, and focusing on what really matters in your life before you retire, or IF you retire, as my friend Stuart Varney talks about in that chapter.
Whereas my last book was targeted at young women, this book has a much larger audience and isn’t specifically targeted at women. I included advice from a wide variety of people so that I could get as many perspectives as possible into the book. I think I’ll be a better mentor now that I have put into a one-stop shop so much rich new advice.
Here’s who I think would benefit from reading ""I Wish Someone Had Told Me"":
* Ambitious young people trying to figure out what they want to do and what industry they want to go into
* Young career enthusiasts going for their first promotion and trying to climb to the next rung on the ladder
* Solidifying your position in the workforce and achieving that next level of success in management, as an entrepreneur, or on the executive track
* New parents who are trying to figure out how to handle the responsibilities of work and family
* Anyone feeling burned out and wondering about switching careers
* Managers looking for fresh ways to give guidance to their employees — to help train, encourage, and recruit talent.
* Those searching for a bigger meaning in their life beyond their career
I learned so much, such as how to better handle disappointment and rejection; how to stay curious and be a person that continues to grow; and how to laugh at circumstances instead of getting bogged down by them.
SHORT QUESTIONS WITH DANA PERINO FOR TOM SHILLUE
In particular, for example, I loved how Martha MacCallum said that when she was working in television and raising her three young children that she didn’t let herself think more than three months ahead. That’s excellent, practical advice that works for anyone — even those without children (but with a Percy!).
I think I’ll be a better mentor now that I have put into a one-stop shop so much rich new advice that I can use to inform my thinking.
Fox News' Dana Perino of ""America's Newsroom.""
That choosing to be loved is not a career-limiting decision. Back in 1997, when I met Peter on an airplane (it happens, I swear!), I was quite worried about what would happen to my career track if I moved to England to marry him — a guy 18 years my senior who’d been divorced twice before, and someone I’d known for only a few months. I was way too preoccupied with what others would think of me, how they’d judge me, if I chose to go for it.
A family friend pulled me aside that Christmas and asked me what was going on with Peter and me. I explained my hesitation. And she said, ""Don’t give up on this chance to be loved. It may be your only shot."" And boy was she right.
""Choosing to be loved helped make my career possible.""
Making that decision turned out to be the very best one of my life. Twenty-eight years later we are still together, and we pinch ourselves every day that we came so close to not meeting that day. I almost missed that flight, and Peter nearly took an earlier one. That we were assigned seats next to each other was a gift from God that we can never repay.
The best we can do is pass on this advice to everyone — choosing to be loved helped make my career possible. Without him, I wouldn’t have accomplished what I have so far — and nothing I’d have done would have mattered at all if I didn’t have him to share it with me.
Fox News' Dana Perino has written a new book of advice.
I wish someone had told me that I didn’t have to worry my 20s away — that, as an educated American woman, I had already won life’s great lottery.

Worry was a waste of time and my greatest hope is that readers will take away some practical tips that they can apply to their lives to ensure that they’re getting the most out of their time on earth. It goes so fast — and I’d buy anyone’s minutes if I could.
Since that’s impossible, I’m just determined to make the most of the time I have here with all of you.

Dana Perino currently co-anchors FOX News Channel's (FNC) morning news program America’s Newsroom (weekdays 9-11 AM/ET) and serves as co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6 PM/ET), the most watched program in cable news. Perino also hosts FOX News Audio’s weekly podcast Perino on Politics. She joined the network in 2009 as a contributor.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/holy-week-underway-americans-leaving-church-not-god-study","With Holy Week underway, Americans are leaving church — but not God: study","Butch Wilmore praised his pastors and talked about how essential worshiping with his Earth-bound congregation was while he was stranded in space for nine months.
As millions gather in churches around the country for Holy Week services, a quiet revolution is unfolding: More Americans are leaving the pews — not because they've lost faith, but to find it on their own terms.
A major new study shows that belief isn’t disappearing, but it is changing. A decadelong research project found that while fewer people are attending services or identifying with a religion, many are still praying, meditating, and holding onto their faith, just on their own terms.
The nationally representative and probability-based study, published in ""Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World,"" tracked more than 1,300 teenagers from 2003 to 2013, following them into adulthood.
Researchers used survey data, interviews, and education records to understand how religious beliefs and practices evolved over time.
INSIDE DONALD TRUMP’S RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, IN HIS OWN WORDS: 'I WAS SAVED'
People join hands in prayer during a Bible study. Researchers report a noticeable generational shift, with younger Americans showing reduced engagement in both public and private religious practices. (iStock)
What they found points to a major shift: People are stepping away from religious institutions, not from spirituality.
Weekly church attendance dropped from 26% to 8%. The number of young people who said they didn't attend services jumped from 17% to nearly 58%.
Religious affiliation — whether identifying as Christian, Catholic, or other — fell from almost 89% to 60%.
But belief in God didn’t fall as sharply. It dipped from 83% to 66%.
And while fewer people are praying every day, the decline wasn’t nearly as steep as church attendance, the study found. Meanwhile, the number of people practicing meditation or other spiritual routines nearly doubled.
BISHOP BARRON CRITICIZES ‘TIRED ARGUMENTS’ USED AGAINST CHRISTIANITY EVERY EASTER, OFFERS NEW SIGN OF HOPE
A recent study finds a generational drop in private prayer, especially among younger Americans who are less likely to engage in religious practices outside formal worship spaces. (iStock)
The researchers call this ""individualization."" Instead of belonging to a church or following a religious group, more people are shaping their own spiritual paths — keeping what resonates, and leaving the rest behind.
One of the biggest reasons people left organized religion? Conflict with political values, especially around issues like same-sex marriage and traditional gender roles.
Many participants described walking away from churches they saw as judgmental or out of step with their beliefs.
One former Catholic said he stopped going to Mass after hearing sermons against same-sex marriage.
""I used to love coming to church,"" he said. ""I don’t anymore.""
Another participant said she believed in God, but ""not in the way churches tell you to.""
Despite declining church attendance, the study shows that many older adults continue private prayer, a habit not as common among younger age groups. (iStock)
The study also found political views made a difference.
Liberals were more likely than conservatives to leave religion, and support for same-sex marriage and abortion was linked to greater declines in church attendance and religious affiliation. But the trend wasn’t limited to one political group; attendance declined across the board just at different rates.

Rather than describing this as secularization or becoming less religious, the researchers argue this is a shift in how people practice faith.
Belief is moving away from formal institutions and toward more personal, often private expressions of spirituality. Many who left organized religion still pray, meditate, or say they believe in something greater.

(Credit: TikTok / @vinylswithvic)
Is it hot in here, or is it just the firemen?
A romance book event featuring bestselling author Abby Jimenez got an unexpected — and on-brand — twist when a fire alarm went off, prompting the real-life arrival of firefighters that had the crowd of 400 mostly female attendees in Canada absolutely roaring.
OKLAHOMA WOMAN CHARGED WITH LAUNDERING $1.5M FROM ELDERLY WOMEN IN ONLINE ROMANCE SCAM
Jimenez was appearing alongside fellow romance author Hannah Bonam-Young to promote her newest novel, ""Just for the Summer,"" when the alarm interrupted the evening.
As emergency crews responded, the firefighters entered the venue and the room erupted in cheers.

""Did a fire alarm go off in the middle of my Toronto event with @authorhannahby?"" Jimenez posted on Instagram. ""Yes. Did a crew of hot firemen show up? Also yes.""
HOW TO NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH AI-POWERED ROMANCE SCAMMERS
Bonam-Young took full advantage of the moment, jokingly asking the firefighters, ""Are any of you single?"" She later shared footage on TikTok, which quickly went viral.
""They were not actually paid actors,"" Jimenez clarified in the same Instagram post. ""But we would have paid them, because it was beyond amazing.""
The firemen entered the event to cheers and applause from the Abby Jimenez fans. (TikTok / @vinylswithvic)
According to reports, the fire was a false alarm and no real emergency, just a perfect plot twist. But that didn’t stop fans from drawing the obvious parallels to the romantic comedy tropes they came to celebrate.
The moment lit up social media with attendees posting clips of the cheering, laughing crowd. Some even joked it felt like a scene lifted right out of one of Jimenez’s novels.

No injuries were reported, and after the all-clear was given, the event continued a little more exciting, and a lot more memorable, than expected.
Toronto Fire Services did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/office-air-ruining-workers-appearance","‘Office Air’ Ruining Workers’ Appearance","'Office air' is being blamed for workers’ appearance declining throughout the day. An expert weighs in on how to protect your skin, hair and nails from the beauty depleting phenomenon.
As the hours in the office tick by, many workers say their carefully crafted appearance begins to fall apart—according to a new TikTok trend.  Hope Dougherty, an accountant, sums up her experience. ""I’ll do my hair, I’ll do my makeup, I’ll put on a nice outfit, and I always feel like by the end of the day, it’s like I had not done any of those things,"" Dougherty says. ""My makeup is almost completely gone, my hair has fallen, and I just generally feel very uncomfortable and gross.""
And she's not alone.  Employees across the country are blaming the ""office air"" phenomenon for drying out their skin, making their hair frizz up, and melting off their makeup - long before 5 o'clock hits.  The theories pointing to extreme heating and air-conditioning and a lack of fresh air. Dermatologist Susan Massick says, ""Air may be recycled, recirculated, so the air tends to be very dry, so not a lot of moisture in the air, not a lot of humidity.""  She adds that fluorescent lighting is another culprit, ""Keep in mind that if you're taking a look in the mirror, trying to do selfies at work, the lighting is not great. So, when you have artificial light, really harsh fluorescent lightings, it's going to look like you have more to washed out or pale appearance.""
""Office air"" not only impacts how workers look and feel,  Dougherty explains how the toll on her appearance can also impact her performance, ""If you don't feel good you are not as focused because your mind is being diverted to think about how gross you feel.... you are not as confident, and that is very important in a workplace, especially for women.""
Dr. Massick emphasizes that while the air itself isn't toxic, there are additional factors to consider, including, long hours, blue light from your computer, and stress.  ""Stress can make a huge impact when it comes to your skin, how you're feeling. And it can be work stress. It can be work-life balance stress. It can be lots of different stressors.  She continues, ""And then when you're stressed, the increased cortisol levels, you might find that your regular skin conditions, whether you have eczema or psoriasis are much, much worse.""
If you're experiencing symptoms of ""office air"" Dr. Massick suggests using a simple skin care regimen to prevent it, suggesting, ""You want people to have a good moisturizer. It helps replenish the moisture, hydrate the skin.  We want to make sure that you're using a daily sunscreen because you can have ultraviolet light exposure, but also the high energy visible light, which can be associated with fluorescent lighting, computer screens.""

DJ Daniel, the teenage boy who was made a Secret Service agent during President Donald Trump's speech to Congress in March, has been sworn into another federal agency.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum helped Daniel – a cancer survivor – fulfill his goal of being sworn into 1,000 law enforcement agencies by swearing him in as an honorary United States Park Police officer on Sunday.
""DJ's resilience in his battle against cancer has inspired the nation. It was an honor to meet with him and his family today at @Interior!"" Burgum wrote on X.

Daniel made national headlines when Trump acknowledged him during his joint address to Congress on March 4 and deemed him an honorary Secret Service agent.
He had the opportunity to visit the Secret Service Training Center on March 19, where he congratulated the latest graduating class alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secret Service Director Sean Curran, and then went on a tour of the facility.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/inside-donald-trumps-relationship-god-his-own-words","Inside Donald Trump’s relationship with God, in his own words: 'I was saved'","A compilation of President Trump's remarks on his and the nation's relationship with God from the past year. (Credit: White House / FOX / National Faith Advisory Board)
It’s Holy Week, and President Donald Trump isn’t just leading the country, he is leaning hard into the belief that he’s been chosen to do so.
With renewed spiritual fervor and a flair for providential drama, Trump has been weaving his personal faith into the fabric of his presidency, especially after surviving an assassination attempt last year.
""I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason,"" he declared during his address to a joint session of Congress last month. ""I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that.""
It’s a sentiment that’s becoming central to Trump's second term. At the National Prayer Breakfast in February, Trump reflected more personally: ""It changed something in me, I feel. I feel even stronger. I believed in God, but I feel much more strongly about it.""
TRUMP ANNOUNCES PICKS FOR AMBASSADORSHIPS TO COMBAT ANTISEMITISM AND PROMOTE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
According to Trump, it wasn’t just a lucky turn of the head — it was divine intervention. As he tells it, he looked toward a chart at just the right moment.
""God did that. I mean, it had to be,"" he said.
Even Don Jr., Trump's loyal son and hunting enthusiast, chimed in.
""He told me the chance of missing from that distance was like missing a one-foot putt. There had to be somebody that saved you, and I think I know who it is,"" Don Jr. said, ""and he looked up.""
Trump often credits his Presbyterian upbringing for instilling his early sense of morality, and, as he tells it, his destiny. At the 2024 National Faith Summit, he recalled attending Sunday school, watching Billy Graham crusades, and being raised by a devout Scottish mother and a ""very strong"" but ""great-hearted"" father.

""I was blessed to be raised in a churched home… and that faith lives on in my heart every single day,"" Trump added.
That foundation, he argues, is critical not just for him personally, but for the soul of the country.
Over the past two years, Trump has repeatedly sounded the alarm over America’s spiritual decline.
In an August 2024 sit-down with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, he said bluntly: ""One of the reasons that our country has lost, sort of, everything — it’s lost so much — is we don’t have religion to the same extent.""
BISHOP BARRON CRITICIZES ‘TIRED ARGUMENTS’ USED AGAINST CHRISTIANITY EVERY EASTER, OFFERS NEW SIGN OF HOPE
Trump often returns to the government’s role during the pandemic as a flashpoint.
""People weren’t even allowed to meet outside… They’d arrest everybody. They were fascists. They were horrible,"" he said. ""That was a very bad time for organized religion — but religion, you know, it gives you some hope. Gee, if I’m good, I’m going to heaven.""
At the 2023 Faith and Freedom Coalition event, he warned, ""Religion is going down in terms of importance and popularity. This is not a question of popularity. We love God, and we want to protect ourselves. It keeps you sane. It keeps you honest. It keeps you good. It keeps you kind. It makes you help other people. And they’re trying to take that away from you.""

From the White House podium to packed mega-church rallies, Trump has used his presidency to advocate for religious liberty as a cornerstone of his leadership.
""As long as I’m president, no one is going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what is in your heart,"" he said during his first term in 2017 — and he has echoed that promise ever since.
""Faith inspires us to be better, to be stronger, to be more caring and giving… It is time to put a stop to the attacks on religion,"" he said.
Trump's made international religious freedom a consistent part of his agenda, too. In a 2017 interview with Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) host David Brody, Trump focused on persecuted Christians.
""They’ve been horribly treated… If you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States… We are going to help them,"" he said.
Trump continues to link America’s founding ideals directly to faith.
""Our Declaration of Independence proclaims that our rights are bestowed on us by our Creator,"" he said at the 2019 National Day of Prayer dinner. ""Each time we pledge allegiance to our flag, we say that we are one nation under God.""

At the 2017 National Prayer Breakfast, he added: ""Freedom is not a gift from the government, but that freedom is a gift from God. America will thrive, as long as we continue to have faith in each other and faith in God.""
Whether he’s recounting Sunday school memories or a bullet that missed ""where it counts,"" Trump’s messaging in 2025 is unmistakable — he believes he’s not just leading a country, he’s fulfilling a divine mission.

""I enjoy a very great relationship with God and a very great relationship"" with evangelical Christian voters, he told CNN host Jake Tapper in 2016. ""I live a very different life than probably a lot of people would think… I try to lead a good life and I have.""
Now, nearly a decade later, it’s a message that’s only grown louder, more personal, and — in his view — more providential.
""It might have touched [my hair],"" he said of the would-be assassin’s bullet. ""But not where it counts.""
In Trump's own words: ""I believed in God… but now something happened.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/new-book-reveals-untold-story-gen-wainwright-highest-ranking-american-pow-world-war-ii","New book reveals untold story of Gen. Wainwright, highest-ranking American POW of World War II","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
With the United States observing National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day on April 9, Fox News anchor and former White House press secretary Dana Perino interviewed former White House speechwriter and historian Jonathan Horn about his newest book, ""The Fate of the Generals."" The book tells the true story of Gen. Jonathan Wainwright, the highest-ranking American POW of World War II.
–
Dana Perino: Who was Gen. Jonathan Wainwright?
Jonathan Horn: Gen. Wainwright was a gritty cavalryman who grew up in Montana not far from the Little Bighorn battlefield — the site of one of history’s most famous last stands — but who could not have known that he would one day have to make a last stand of his own. It happened in the Philippines (then an American colony) during the early days of World War II, when the Japanese invaded the islands after attacking Pearl Harbor.
US ARMY VETERAN STARTS SUCCESSFUL BARBECUE BUSINESS DESPITE HEALTH CHALLENGES: ‘VERY PROUD’
Wainwright became the top United States commander in the Philippines after his superior Douglas MacArthur received orders to flee the islands, even as his troops there fought on against impossible odds. While MacArthur vowed to return to the islands, Wainwright took a very different oath: to stay there and share the fate of his men, even if it meant surrendering with them and becoming the highest-ranking American prisoner of the Japanese.
Gen. Jonathan Wainwright, right, broadcasts his surrender message following the capture of Corregidor by the Japanese, May 1942. (Dr. Diosdado M. Yap, Editor-Publisher, Bataan Magazine, Washington, D.C., 1971)
Perino: Why does the United States observe National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day on April 9?
Horn: It's the anniversary of the largest surrender of United States forces in history. When the Japanese landed in the Philippines in December 1941, American and Filipino troops fell back into the jungles of the Bataan peninsula, where they fought on without sufficient food or medicine until their bodies could fight on no longer. That sad day came on April 9, 1942.
Nearly 80,000 men lay down their arms. Those who survived the terrors of the Bataan Death March would find new horrors as prisoners of the Japanese. Wainwright would carry on the struggle for another month on a small island called Corregidor, a few miles off the tip of Bataan. He finally agreed to surrender himself and the rest of the Philippines only because he feared the Japanese would otherwise carry out a massacre.

Perino: What happened to Wainwright during his time as a prisoner of the Japanese?
Horn: Wainwright remained a prisoner for the rest of the war. The Japanese subjected him to what he called ""systematic starvation"" and beatings as they moved him from the Philippines to camps in Taiwan and eventually all the way to Manchuria.
GRANDSON OF FORMER COMMANDANT OF AUSCHWITZ ON RISE OF ANTISEMITISM, HIS LIFE AS A PASTOR
Perhaps the cruelest torture was isolation from the outside world. Receiving no letters for long periods and cut off from the news, Wainwright worried that the American people would never forgive him for the decision he had made to surrender for the sake of his men.

Perino: When Wainwright returned to America after the war, he received a hero’s welcome and the Medal of Honor. Why do you think so many Americans today are unfamiliar with his name?
Horn: The story of MacArthur's vow to return to the Philippines has overshadowed the story of Wainwright's vow to stay with his men there. More than four decades have passed since a biography about Wainwright last came out.
During that time, boxes of Wainwright's personal papers, including his diaries and letters, have become available for research in military archives. As a result, it’s possible to tell his story now in a way never before possible and to restore him to his proper place in history.

Perino: What lesson do you hope Americans today will draw from Wainwright’s story?
Horn: I hope Americans today will remember the lesson Wainwright himself drew from his terrible ordeal: the need for military preparedness. I also hope they will never forget the courage he and his fellow prisoners of war showed and the sacrifice they made for our country.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/covid-five-years-later-impact-travel","COVID Five Years Later: Impact on Travel","Travel came to a halt during the COVID-19 pandemic. Five years later, it’s back, but where and how we travel has changed.
Reopening the world to globetrotters post-pandemic has been a long journey.  In 2020 Americans were locked down, with flights grounded, cruises docked, and all non-essential travel halted.  In the months that followed, passengers slowly returned to once-empty airports, navigating social distancing, masks mandates, and staffing shortages.  Now, as travel continues to bounce back, Stacey Barber, Vice President of Travel at AAA, notes, ""What we're seeing is people are taking the trip. They're not postponing it. They're not waiting for kids to be off school.  And they're not only taking one trip, they're taking multiple trips.""
One emerging trend, Americans are now traveling year-round, rather than during peak seasons.  This shift is partly due to the growing flexibility for many people have to work from anywhere.  Barber highlights, ""They want to enjoy these beautiful destinations and activities and, you know, work from home. And that remote availability has really increased that opportunity.""
Tourists are also shifting what they want in a destination, favoring less crowded locations, personalized experiences, and an increased focus on mental health and well-being.   Starlight Williams, Digital Editor at National Geographic, explains,  ""Everyone is thinking about they're stressed out, they're tired, they're burnt out. 'How can I go travel and experience that I'm creating a healing moment?'""
Across the industry, these new demands mean big changes. According to Barber, ""Suppliers are really putting a strong emphasis on health. They're putting it on cleaning, and they have great insurance opportunities available to help protect the those consumers.""
The pandemic was not smooth sailing for the cruise industry, But, it has since bounced back in a big way.  ""They were the last industry to really rebound from COVID,"" Barber says, ""Post-pandemic, they are really creating an experience. They are enhanced their ships during covid. They created more inventory as well.""
Air travel, however, has been slower to get off the ground.  ""The global airline capacity is only 2.4% above 2019 levels,"" Williams notes, ""That's been hindered by aircraft shortages having train crew deficits. There's not enough staff.""
Despite any turbulence, experts agree travel continues to evolve.  Barber points out, ""We're going to start understanding how technology can help anticipate needs of consumers better, how we can provide more time saving services.""   That's not the only way travel could change five years from now.  Williams predicts, ""Supersonic flights are going to make a full dramatic return, cold destinations are going to be the biggest trend, with global temperatures rising, [and] global wellness is going to go even more insane.""
Another potential shift in the coming years is a resurgence in travelers turning to travel agents, particularly among younger generations.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/covid-5-years-later-impact-workplace","COVID 5 Years Later: Impact on the Workplace","Five years after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the American workplace looks a lot different, driven by remote work that could be here to stay.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on American workplaces, reshaping where we work, how we do our jobs, and employee priorities. According to Glassdoor's Lead Economist, Daniel Zhao, ""there's more flexibility in today's workplace, whether that means remote or hybrid options.""
Once uncommon, remote work has become the norm.  When the pandemic struck in 2020, offices quickly adapted to allow employees to work from home, forever altering how business operate. However, not everyone believes this shift should be permanent. C-E-O and founder of Vox Funding, Adam Benowitz argues it's time to return to in-person work, saying, ""I think everyone benefits from in-person work and coming in and collaborating. Decision making is more is quicker. Friendships are made; bonds are formed that are hard to form when everybody's working in their house.""  Benowitz, is not alone in his belief that over the next five years, businesses will return to a pre-pandemic work model. Major companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple are already requiring employees to return to the office.  Benowitz adds, ""People are, by and large, realizing the that people need to be together. And we're moving back toward that.... I think you're going to see more things like four-day weeks with a little flextime.""
But not everyone agrees with this perspective.  Zhao believes remote work is here to stay, noting, ""It's just an important reminder that even though there might be some big companies that are making changes, a lot of Americans are employed at small to medium businesses, and there's a lot of experimentation from those smaller and medium sized businesses where they might get more benefit from being able to hire all the way across the country.""
What both sides do agree on is that the future of work is likely to be hybrid.  In 2021 and 2022, we experienced ""The Great Resignation."" Coming out of that, offices began prioritizing overall well-being. And, both employee and employer are focusing on work-life balance.  As Zhao observes, ""There's certainly more awareness now about the power and possibility of flexibility in the workplace. That also means flexibility around hours and allowing workers to pop out of the office early if they need to go pick up their kids.""
This shift is especially beneficial for younger Americans. In 2024, 84% of millennials and 74% of Gen Z expressed a desire for more remote work options. Still, some, like Benowitz, believe working in an office is more valuable, ""Those are the generations that need it the most, that are on their way up there trying to learn. Learn new skills, learn who they are, make new friendships think we are cheating those younger generations if we're not bringing them into the office and they'll regret it later.""
While hybrid schedules offer numerous benefits, such as eliminating the commute, reducing stress, and providing more time at home. Companies also benefit by downsizing office space and tapping into a broader talent pool.

(Credit: Yavapai County Sheriff's Office)
A dog in Arizona that fell into a 10-foot-deep sinkhole was rescued days later after a utility worker passing by heard it barking for help.
The Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office said its Animal Control division responded to a report on Friday of a dog that was stuck in a deep hole in Prescott Valley.
The person who called was a utility worker who told law enforcement he nearly fell into the hole when he heard barking coming from below.
When he looked down into the hole, the worker told authorities, he was surprised to see there was a small dog down there.

In a video shared on Facebook by the sheriff’s office, the worker said, ""That little guy’s stuck.""
""Oh, my goodness,"" the officer said. ""Hey, buddy. Hey. We’ll get you out here.""
When the animal control officer arrived on the scene, he assessed the situation, borrowed a ladder from nearby and climbed to the bottom of the hole to retrieve the dog before carrying it to safety.

Authorities say the hole was over 10 feet deep, and the dog had possibly sustained injuries to its front legs.
After attempting to locate the dog’s owner, the officer transported his new furry friend to get medical treatment.

Others posted in disbelief that the hole was left open and should be covered up before anyone, or anything, else gets hurt or even killed.

But many users praised the officer for rescuing the pup.
""Thank you, sir, for rescuing this beautiful!"" a user exclaimed. ""I can't imagine what this poor little animal went through. You are truly a hero. God bless you!!""

NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore, who was stranded in space for nearly a year, touched on the importance of faith during a press conference on Monday.
Wilmore spent nine months aboard the International Space Station (ISS) with fellow astronaut Suni Williams, beginning in June 2024. The pair were stuck there for over 280 days, though they initially planned to be there for only eight days.
After landing at the ISS, the astronauts' Boeing Starliner spacecraft encountered technical issues, which led NASA to decide it was unsafe to return the astronauts to Earth. The Biden administration was blamed by critics for leaving the astronauts stranded, and Williams and Wilmore returned to Earth on the SpaceX Dragon capsule on March 18.
At the Monday press conference, Wilmore was candid about his relationship with God when a reporter asked about faith in space.

""I heard that you were still attending your church services from space. Can you tell me a bit about why that was important for you to do?"" the journalist asked.
""Well, goodness, the Word of God … I need it,"" the astronaut began. ""My pastors are the finest pastors on or off, in this case, the planet.""
""And to tie in and to worship with my church family was vital,"" Wilmore added. ""I mean, it's part of what makes me go.""
Wilmore also shouted out a Tennessee church, saying he would watch their services while aboard the ISS.

""I also [tuned] into Grace Baptist Church in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. A buddy of mine is an elder there and a pastor there, and I would watch their service as well, every single week,"" the astronaut continued.
Wilmore described the weekly services as ""invigorating"" and emphasized how important Christian fellowship is to him.
""Part of what I need, as a believer in Jesus Christ, to continue that focus – a system, day in and day out, because I need that fellowship, even though it's fellowship from afar,"" Wilmore explained.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/experts-reveal-details-16th-century-catholic-saint-perfectly-preserved","Experts reveal details about a 16th-century Catholic saint found 'perfectly preserved': 'Truly unique'","St. Sebastian, a third-century martyr, has been revered as a saint for nearly 2,000 years.
Researchers are beginning to release details about a 16th-century Catholic saint whose body was found miraculously ""incorrupt"" last year.
St. Teresa of Jesus, also known as St. Teresa of Avila, was a Discalced Carmelite nun who died in 1582. In September, the Diocese of Avila announced that officials had opened her tomb in Alba de Tormes, Spain, for the first time in 110 years, and the results were extraordinary.
""The uncovered parts, which are the face and foot, are the same as they were in 1914,"" Father Marco Chiesa said at the time. ""There is no color, there is no skin color, because the skin is mummified, but it is seen, especially in the middle of the face.
""[It] looks good,"" he added. ""Expert doctors see Teresa's face almost clearly.""

According to the Spanish newspaper Salamanca RTV Al Día, Discalced Carmelites received a 53-page preliminary analysis of the saint's condition March 15. The report details the state of the relics, which include her body, left arm and heart in Alba de Tormes.
Italian anthropology professor Luigi Capasso described St. Teresa's remains as ""perfectly preserved.""
""The right foot, left hand, heart and left arm are perfectly preserved, with intact skin, subcutaneous tissues and muscles in place and no signs of degradation,"" Capasso told the outlet.

St. Teresa's corpse also maintains preserved strands of brown hair, in addition to one right eyelid and a dark iris, according to the Spanish outlet. Remarkably, some of her nasal tissues were still intact.
""This preservation, more than 400 years after her death, transmits a serenity that reflects how she faced her departure,"" Capasso said.

Researchers chalk up St. Teresa's remarkable condition to the dry atmosphere of her tomb because excessive moisture typically accelerates the decomposing process. Capasso said his team has taken special care to ""block any future degradation, mechanical or biological.""

""It is a truly unique natural phenomenon,"" the professor said.
The newest observations come after the Carmelites released their initial findings last year. After St. Teresa's tomb was opened last summer, experts said they were able to determine her health conditions before she died.

The 2025 World Happiness Report was recently released this month – revealing that the U.S. not only trails behind other countries in North America, but several European countries as well.
The study, which is published every year by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford, typically ranks Nordic countries highly. The theme of this year's report is the ""impact of caring and sharing on people’s happiness,"" according to the study.
Several factors, including inequality, generosity, freedom, life expectancy and perceptions of corruption, all contribute to the rankings – but one question related to happiness is weighed heavily by researchers.
""Our global happiness ranking is based on a single question that asks people to evaluate the quality of their life on a 0–10 scale,"" the site explains.

The U.S. has ranked low in the study over the past few years, despite being ranked as the 11th happiest country in 2011. The study also ranked U.S. as the 115th freest country, with the study asking participants, ""Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?""
Despite its low happiness and freedom ranking, the U.S. boasts a high GDP at $76,276 per capita and is ranked in fourth place for GDP. The U.S. also ranked 12th and 16th in social support and generosity, respectively.
""The increasing number of people who eat alone is one reason for declining wellbeing in the United States,"" the study notes, adding that the decline in happiness and social trust in the U.S. ""explains a large share of the rise in political polarization and votes against 'the system.'""

Kristin Vanderzanden, in San Antonio. (Credit: American Humane Society)
K-9 veteran ""Frenky,"" a 10-year-old German shepherd trained in explosive detection and bite work, has been reunited with his handler by the American Humane Society (AHS) after three years apart.
The AHS Military Working Dog (MWD) Reunification program brought together Frenky and his handler, Army Staff Sgt. Kristin Vanderzanden, in San Antonio.
They worked together from 2017 through 2021, and the K-9 was retired in January. Frenky's first handler was Vanderzanden during his tenure, and the dog was her first K-9.

Vanderzanden, one of two drill sergeants for the Army’s MWD program, served with the K-9 for nearly 4½ years. Their service together included a nine-month combat tour in Afghanistan and a 10-month combat tour in Iraq.

Frenky's composure during a mission with several U.S. casualties after encountering sniper fire and mortar rounds in Afghanistan allowed the MWD to continue searching for explosives. The K-9 became something of a mascot for the U.S. Special Forces team afterward on base for his ""sweet, goofy personality,"" according to Vanderzanden.
Bonding beyond protocol, Frenky slept on the floor of Vanderzanden's room during their deployment in Afghanistan instead of his kennel.

Vanderzanden and Frenky also completed 20 Secret Service missions together, protecting the president and first lady and several foreign dignitaries.
Vanderzanden was reassigned to Fort Drum in northern New York in 2021, separating her from Frenky. In an interview with the AHS, Vanderzanden shared that she was devastated to leave Frenky at Fort Johnson in Louisiana, saying that ""it was like leaving a child behind.""

Vanderzanden also said she was ""chomping at the bit"" to see Frenky again when it was rumored he may retire due to old age. Frenky served with three handlers during his military service but is especially close to Vanderzanden.
The reunification program paid for the K-9's travel from Fort Johnson to San Antonio to reunite Vanderzanden and Frenky.
AHS will also cover all veterinary costs for the rest of Frenky's life.

Vanderzanden is excited to give Frenky the opportunity to enjoy being a dog, relaxing on the couch and living in a home instead of a kennel, according to the release.
""Frenky is an extraordinary dog who made invaluable contributions to our country,"" Dr. Robin Ganzert, AHS president and CEO, told Fox News Digital.
""Like his fellow military working dogs, Frenky is an unsung hero who deserves our gratitude and respect. American Humane Society was honored to help give him the reunion and retirement he deserves.""

According to the program's site, the ""American Humane Society honors the lifesaving contributions of all veterans, including the military working dogs (MWDs) who risked their lives courageously serving our country.""
Frenky will join Vanderzanden's other dog, a German shepherd and cattle dog mix named Cora, as the newest member of the family.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/discovery-partial-fossilized-face-fossil-belongs-oldest-human-ancestor-western-europe-new-study-says","Discovery of partially fossilized face belongs to oldest human ancestor in Western Europe, new study says","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A fragment of a face from a human ancestor is the oldest in Western Europe, according to the results of a new study published this week.
The incomplete skull — a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw – was found in northern Spain in 2022 and published in the journal Nature on Wednesday.
Archaeologists believe the fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old.
Researchers hope the discovery will provide some new insights about the first inhabitants of Western Europe during the Early Pleistocene epoch. Much of the available information from Western Europe is confined to the Iberian Peninsula.
ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER ‘CREEPY’ PUPPETS IN ODD LOCATION: ‘THIS THING ALMOST MOVED’
This photo provided by the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in March 2025 shows archaeological excavation work at the Sima del Elefante site in Sierra de Atapuerca, Burgos, Spain, where a fossil from a hominin between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old was found.  (Maria D. Guillén/IPHES-CERCA via AP)
While a collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in the country of Georgia, the Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors ""were taking excursions into Europe"" at that time, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian's Human Origins Program, told The Associated Press.
ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNEARTH RARE ARTIFACTS BENEATH HARRIET TUBMAN'S FAMILY HOME
Still, there is no evidence that the earliest arrivals stayed there long, Potts said, noting that they may have ventured into other locations and then died out.

Guillén/IPHES-CERCA, Elena Santos/CENIEH via AP)
The partial skull bears similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.

Guillén/IPHES-CERCA via AP)
Homo erectus arose around 2 million years ago and moved from Africa to regions of Asia and Europe, with the last individuals dying out around 100,000 years ago, said Potts.

Guillén/IPHES-CERCA via AP)
It can be challenging to identify which group of early humans a fossil find belongs to if there's only a single fragment versus many bones that show a range of features, said University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer, who was not involved in the study.

The same cave complex in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains where the new fossil was found also previously yielded other significant clues to the ancient human past. Researchers working in the region have also found more recent fossils of Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Kiss me, I'm Irish! – but you better behave.
Boston officials are hoping an earlier start time for this year's iconic South Boston St. Patrick's Day parade will tamp down on the ""tomfoolery.""
The two-for-one celebration – a St. Patrick's Day and Evacuation Day parade – is slated to kick off at 11:30 a.m. local time on Sunday, March 16. That's an hour-and-a-half earlier than past years as politicians and parade organizers attempt to prevent bad behavior from revelers.
""The parade will be starting earlier this year in an attempt to get a better handle on the tomfoolery,"" state Sen. Nick Collins said in a statement to local outlet, the Dorchester Reporter. ""Last year, there were regrettable moments at the parade that we don’t want to see repeated this time around.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Collins, as well as City Councilor Ed Flynn, both of whom called for reforms to the parade after chaos ensued last year.
""Operate under the golden rule, and if you wouldn’t do it back home – don’t do it here,"" Flynn, a retired U.S. Navy veteran that served during Operation Enduring Freedom, told Fox News Digital.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox shared a similar message.

""We ask anyone coming to treat this event, and the neighborhood, as if it was your home,"" Cox said. ""Boston is a welcoming city, but the fact is, we do not welcome unruly and unlawful behavior.""

""This is a family-friendly event. This is not a drinking fest,"" Cox continued.
Cox said all liquor stores in South Boston will close at 4 p.m., taverns and restaurants will stop admitting people at 6 p.m. and they'll stop serving alcohol at 7 p.m.

South Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade is one of the largest in the United States. Last year's parade drew about a million people.
Hooley said the parade was ""not as well-behaved last year"" and it was particularly driven by ""young, intoxicated people in general and the fighting associated with it.""

Multiple people were arrested at last year's parade, according to local outlet Boston 25 News. Issues included disturbing incidents of violence, assaults that went viral, people on rooftops without a roof deck, and beer cans being thrown at parade marchers, the outlet reported.

""If you are a guest, or in South Boston for the Evacuation Day Parade – show some common courtesy and respect for the residents, for our veterans and military families, our dedicated first responders, and our history,"" Flynn said.
The parade is also a celebration of Evacuation Day – the evacuation of British troops from Boston on March 17, 1776.

Archaeologists digging in Central America recently uncovered strange 2,400-year-old clay puppets in an unexpected place.
The discoveries, which were found on top of El Salvador's San Isidro pyramid, were published in an article entitled ""Of puppets and puppeteers: Preclassic clay figurines from San Isidro, El Salvador,"" on Mar. 5. The ancient Mesoamerican puppets date back between 410 and 380 B.C.
Pictures show the puppets possessing eerie open-mouthed facial expressions. The largest puppets of the group are around a foot long, and are ""naked and devoid of hair or jewelry,"" while the smallest ones are ""modeled with locks of hair on their foreheads and earspools in the lobes,"" according to the study.
Researchers determined that the artifacts were puppets because of the holes in their heads, which string could easily fit through.

""The three larger figurines have articulated, adjustable heads, facilitated by conical protrusions on the necks and matching sockets in the base of each head,"" the study described. ""Each socket has two holes drilled through to the top of the head, and each neck protrusion has one horizontal hole and a shallow vertical canal on each side, allowing a string to be passed through the neck and tied on the top of the head.""
The figurines may have served a variety of purposes, the study argues, including ""being, effectively, marionettes or puppets in re-enactments of certain scenes, both static and dynamic.""

Though the puppets were discovered naked, researchers believe that they once wore costumes, as earrings for similar figurines have been discovered at Mesoamerican sites in the past.
One of the researchers, Jan Szymański, told Science that the puppets are even creepier in person.

""You shift your gaze just a little bit and it seems like, oof, this thing almost moved.""

Szymański also noted that the puppets' final resting place at the top of the pyramid suggests that they may have been ritually important.
""They can be employed in a variety of different performances before being finally deposited as something really, really special,"" the researcher said. ""I would say a tomb, but we don’t have the body.""
Though researchers are unclear about how exactly the puppets were used, the excavation of the pyramid is still ongoing – and archaeologists are still looking for answers.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/changed-my-life-first-sunday-lent-prayerful-preparation-easter","'Changed my life': First Sunday of Lent brings prayer, preparation for Easter","Fox News senior correspondent Benjamin Hall interviews actor Mark Wahlberg about his faith and the start of the Christian season of Lent.
As the liturgical season of Lent enters its first full week, it is a time to adjust one's routine to be in a better place spiritually during the 40 days of the Lenten season, according to Pastor Jesse Bradley of Grace Community Church in Auburn, Washington.
Lent, which began on Ash Wednesday, is a period of preparation for Easter Sunday, the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
Excluding Sundays, Lent comprises the 40 days leading up to the Sacred Paschal Triduum on Holy Thursday.

As Lent begins, now is ""an intentional time to make wise shifts, seek God and walk closely with Jesus,"" Bradley told Fox News Digital.
""It’s time to draw near to Jesus with humility, authenticity and gratitude,"" Bradley said. ""Jesus died for our sins and rose from the grave.""

Ash Wednesday, he said, signifies the ""call to return to God with our affection and devotion.""
During Lent, he said, ""we repent of our sins and receive His grace. We have peace with God through the sacrifice of the Messiah.  Because Jesus overcame the grave, we are set free from shame and despair. The victory of Jesus resonates deeply in our souls.""
POPE FRANCIS BELIEVES 'PAPACY IS FOR LIFE,' SAYS HISTORIAN-BIOGRAPHER
He noted that ""a relationship with God is both personal and eternal. Seek first the kingdom of God. May we abide closely with the One who demonstrated His love on the cross"" for all of us.
Fox News Digital also spoke this week to the team behind the Hallow prayer app. One way that many Christians choose to grow closer to God during Lent is by using technology and prayer apps like Hallow.
""It’s an honor to get to pray alongside so many people, and our prayer challenge for Lent this year is shaping up to be the biggest one of all time,"" CEO Alex Jones told Fox News Digital.

The Catholic prayer and meditation app links technology and faith – and allows users to personalize their prayer experience.
The group is based in Chicago; the app launched in 2018.
This year, actor Chris Pratt has teamed up with Hallow and is sharing his faith journey.

""The theme for this year’s Pray40 challenge is The Way, focusing on John 14:6 and also the incredible book by St. Josemaría Escrívá,"" said Jones.
It's the book that ""changed my own life, and I’m just really excited for folks to experience its powerful spiritual advice and direction.""
Jones added, ""St. Josemaría teaches us to love the world deeply through prayer, serving others and making sacrifices. But all of this can be practiced in our ordinary, daily lives.""
Focusing on Christ as ‘the Way, the Truth, and the Life’ just really gets at the core of Hallow’s mission, which is to help folks pray and follow Him every day.""

Jones noted that he's ""felt for awhile now"" that a ""real revival of faith is happening.""
""A few months ago, there was a report that Bible sales were booming. New data from the Pew Research Center shows that more people in the U.S. identified as Christian in 2024 vs. the previous year.""
""God really is up to something incredible."" (iStock)
He said, ""It’s the blessing of a lifetime to get to help folks pray every day at Hallow and see this revival firsthand, especially folks lost or fallen away who are coming back to the faith or those discovering it for the first time. God really is up to something incredible.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/meet-oldest-llama-world-he-works-sick-children-north-carolina","Meet the oldest llama in the world, who works with sick children in North Carolina","President Donald Trump touts his administration’s border crisis crackdown and presents an executive order renaming a wildlife refuge in honor of Jocelyn Nungaray during his address to a joint session of Congress.
A bucktoothed llama that spends his days comforting chronically ill children at a North Carolina camp founded by NASCAR royalty has been crowned the world’s oldest llama in captivity.
At 27 years and more than 250 days, the selfie- and snuggle-loving llama called Whitetop dethroned Dalai Llama, the Guinness World Records announced last week. Dalai lived on a ranch in Albuquerque and was announced as the oldest in 2023 shortly after his 27th birthday.
Whitetop was donated to the Victory Junction camp in 2006, just two years after race car driver Kyle Petty — the son of NASCAR great Richard Petty — and his family founded the camp in honor of Petty's own son, Adam, who was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash while practicing for a race.

The year-round free camp sits on 84 acres in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, about 75 miles west of Raleigh. It’s designed for children with conditions that include cancer, kidney and heart disease, cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida and an array of neurological and physical disabilities.
Whitetop has become known for his relaxed, sweet and empathetic personality. His go-to move is to lie still while campers pet him, which can comfort children and give them important sensory input, said Billie Davis, the camp's barn director.
""He really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him,"" she said. ""He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is.""

One of his best friends is a miniature highland cow named Gus-Gus, who tends to forget Whitetop is a llama and enjoys jumping on him. Whitetop also likes to roll in fresh wood chippings, chomp on soaked alfalfa and pose for selfies.
""If you try to take a picture of him from the side, he’s not into it,"" Davis said. ""He will, like scoot in there and try to get his face from a side profile so that it’s like he’s cheesing.""
Davis attributes Whitetop's long life to great veterinary care and exercise, as well as simply loving his job.
The average life span of a llama is 15 years, according to the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance.

Whitetop has developed arthritis in his twilight years but otherwise is very healthy, said Davis. And the only times the llama becomes upset is when Gus-Gus, along with two miniature donkeys named Jed and Jethro, leave him alone.
Stephanie Wilkerson, 33, first went to the camp’s family weekend in 2006 after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She said she was initially a little nervous around Whitetop but soon realized petting him and giving him hugs made her feel better.
""When I started stroking him more and more and more, I got more relaxed,"" said Wilkerson, who lives in Thomasville, North Carolina.

With Whitetop’s newfound fame in longevity, the camp has started selling limited edition T-shirts displaying Whitetop with sunglasses and the words, ""Still Spit’n."" The proceeds go to the camp.
Although Davis said Whitetop would like people to know not all llamas spit on you.
""Typically llamas only spit when they are scared, uncomfortable or territorial over something,"" she said. ""And he just loves his job so much that he doesn’t do it.""

Nevada's spot in first place is unsurprising to most, considering Las Vegas' reputation as ""Sin City.""
But WalletHub said that gambling and lust are not the only sins associated with the state, but gluttony as well.
""The state also has the most prostitution arrests in the U.S. and the second-highest number of fast food restaurants, showing that lust and gluttony both have a hold,"" the study said.

""Sadly, Nevada’s pre-occupation with its vices leaves little room for altruism, as the state has the second-lowest volunteer rate in the country. The state also suffers from the second-highest rate of disconnected youth (young people who are not in school or working),"" WalletHub added.
Las Vegas also ranked high on the list of the most fun cities in America.  (iStock)
California, meanwhile, was placed in second due to having ""the third-most mass shootings and the most elder abuse complaints,"" according to the report.
Hollywood's connection to vanity also contributed to the ranking.
""It also has the third-highest rate of bullying on school property, and a very high number of aggravated assault arrests per capita,"" the study found. ""It’s clear that residents’ biggest sins include anger and hatred.""
Florida was placed in third due to the prevalence of white-collar crimes in the Sunshine State, as well as its residents ranking highly for ""sinful"" Internet searches.
""Greed rears its ugly head in the state, as it ranks second when it comes to the number of identity theft and fraud complaints per capita,"" WalletHub said. ""Violent crimes fueled by anger and hatred are also a problem, as Florida has the fifth-highest number of mass shootings.""
California came in #2 on the most ""sinful"" states list, according to a study by WalletHub. (iStock)
""In addition, many Floridians show lust in their online habits. Sunshine State residents rank fourth overall in searching Google for terms related to adultery, prostitution, and pornography,"" the study added.
""Florida ranks high for vanity-related Google searches for terms such as liposuction and breast augmentation, too.""
WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo noted that, while individuals' negative behavior ""may only affect a few people, when these behaviors are exhibited by a high share of a state’s population, the majority of the state’s residents suffer as a result.""
The WalletHub study found Floridians engaged in some not-so-nice online searches.  (iStock)
""States should invest in resources to help people curb vices, such as robust rehabilitation programs for people with gambling and drug addictions,"" Lupo suggested.

(Reuters)
Egyptian officials recently announced the discovery of a 3,000-year-old mining complex, complete with remnants of ancient homes, workshops and even baths.
The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities reported that excavation was conducted at Jabal Sukari, located southwest of the town of Marsa Alam in the Red Sea Governorate, according to a Facebook post published on Feb. 25.
The statement explained that among the discoveries were the remains of a mining camp dating back three millennia. It included ""remnants of a complete factory for extracting gold from quartz veins,"" a translated version of the statement read.

The camp was sophisticated, and there is proof of ""crushing, grinding, and pulverizing quartz stone, passing through filtration and sedimentation basins to the smelting stage in clay furnaces and gold extraction.""

Interestingly, the living quarters of the miners were also discovered, along with ""workshops, mining areas, places of worship, administrative buildings, Ptolemaic baths, and architectural elements from the Roman and Islamic eras,"" the press release said.
Archaeologists also found 628 ostraca, which were broken pieces of pottery and stone that were used to write and draw. The ostraca were written in hieroglyphic scripts, along with Egyptian demotic and Greek.

Excavators also unearthed several Ptolemaic-era bronze coins, plus ""a large collection of terracotta statues depicting human and animal forms from the Greco-Roman period, and small stone statues, some incomplete, of Bastet and Harpocrates, as well as five offering tables from the Ptolemaic era.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/pope-francis-believes-papacy-life-historian-biographer","Pope Francis believes 'papacy is for life,' says historian-biographer","Fox News national correspondent Jeff Paul has the latest on the health status of Pope Francis on ‘Fox Report.’
ROME – Pope Francis has been in the hospital for the longest stay of his papacy, more than two weeks now. And while the latest updates from the Vatican report a slow and steady improvement from his severe bronchitis and double pneumonia, it hasn't stopped the Vaticanista rumor mill from speculating about his possible resignation.
But papal historian, author and biographer Austen Ivereigh is dispelling those rumors, saying that despite the secret letter of resignation he wrote at the beginning of his election as bishop of Rome, Pope Francis believes the papacy is for life.
""He's spoken various times about this,"" Ivereigh told Fox News in an interview. ""He's saying that for him, the papacy is for life.""
POPE REMARKS ON ‘BLESSING’ THAT COMES WITH FRAILTY; SAYS ‘WAR APPEARS EVEN MORE ABSURD’ IN HIS CURRENT STATE
""It's really important in a world where there's a kind of cult of health and youth,"" added Ivereigh, ""that we say, ‘No, there is a mission that God gives you, which is for life.’""
Millions of faithful all over the world have been praying for the 88-year-old pontiff's healing and recovery.

Here in St. Peter's Square, a nightly rosary vigil, led by one of the cardinals of the curia, is keeping the fires of faith lit that Francis will recover.
Ivereigh is the author of ""The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope"" and other books. He believes Pope Francis will recover, perhaps more frail, but still a vibrant spiritual leader.
""There's an anxiety. There's a sense of uncertainty.""
Yet Ivereigh admitted, ""There's an anxiety. There's a sense of uncertainty.""
History has helped provide that anxiety and uncertainty. Francis' predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, resigned in 2013, the first pontiff to do so in more than 500 years.
POPE FRANCIS' MEDICAL CONDITION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BILATERAL PNEUMONIA
But then there are those who may wish he would resign.
Even still, there are those who are circling the wagons knowing it's only a matter of time until cardinals convene in Rome to elect a successor to St. Peter.
Bishop Joseph Strickland, a vocal critic of Pope Francis, wrote an open letter to the College of Cardinals urging them to choose wisely in the next conclave.

In 2018, Pope Francis removed Strickland from his post as bishop of the diocese of Tyler, Texas, after Strickland's public criticisms of the pope.
In his letter to the cardinals, Strickland wrote, ""As the conclave approaches, I feel bound in conscience to share my deep concern – which I know is shared by many bishops, clergy, and members of the lay faithful – that this conclave will attempt the election of a man ineligible to hold the office of pope.""
JD VANCE SHARES SPECIAL MESSAGE TO AILING POPE FRANCIS AMID BREATHING CRISIS
He went on, ""Your Eminences, I would also recall to your mind that you have a grave obligation before God to refuse to give assent to the election of any candidate who does not fulfill the conditions established by divine law.""
Pope Francis has not stopped working, although his frail condition requires that he move a bit slower.
Strickland concluded with thinly veiled accusations against Francis, whom his critics claim does not always hold to the theological truths of the faith.
Wrote Strickland, ""If a public heretic, or a man who is reasonably suspected of being a public heretic, receives sufficient votes, faithful cardinals have an obligation to refuse to accept the validity of his election.""
But Ivereigh says Francis is a man who's more like Jesus, that he has an ability to hold in tension the truths of the faith together with the unconditional love required of all those made in God's image.
Said Ivereigh, ""He proclaims the truth, and at the same time he heals and loves. And in fact, the truth that he proclaims is a healing truth and the healing that he does — it communicates the truth of who God is.""

In his 12 years as bishop of Rome, Pope Francis has continued to mold the Catholic Church in ways that are very different from those of his predecessors.
First, he worked to clean up the mess in the Vatican Bank, and he expanded the College of Cardinals, creating cardinals in faraway places that had never had the high position before, such as in San Diego.

He also elevated a woman to one of the highest-ranking positions in the Vatican: Sister Raffaella Petrini, the new president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State and president of the Governorate of Vatican City State.

From his 10th floor suite at Gemelli Hospital, Francis continues to run the business of the Vatican. He has not stopped working, although his frail condition requires that he move a bit slower.
From working with the pope on projects, Ivereigh knows the Holy Father is a workaholic. And he believes this current health crisis will be resolved in a positive way.

""I think the immediate future is all about him coming out of the hospital, getting back to his residence in Santa Marta for what everybody expects will be a long convalescence,"" Ivereigh said. ""The doctors, I think, are pretty clear about that.""

An anonymous bride on Reddit has alleged a cake-smashing incident ruined her wedding, and her post has led social media users and etiquette experts to debate if the tradition can be harmful.
The bride, who claims to be 27, turned to the ""AITAH"" subreddit where users of the app can vote on who’s to blame in a civil dispute.
The bride asked if she was wrong for abruptly leaving her wedding after her husband smashed cake in her face in front of all of their guests.
BRIDE WHO WENT VIRAL FOR MAKING HER OWN WEDDING CAKE RESPONDS TO CRITICS: 'AMAZING EXPERIENCE'
She wrote that she knew her husband found ""cake smashing videos"" funny and asked him to not do that to her because she’s not fond of the tradition.
An anonymous bride on Reddit writes that she's upset her husband smashed cake onto her face during their wedding reception when she explicitly asked him not to. Now, experts are debating on whether the tradition is damaging or harmless fun. (iStock)
She also wrote that her family ""does the cake smashing thing,"" and at the age of 17, she suffered a cut on her forehead with ""substantial bleeding"" when her mother shoved her face into her birthday cake. A cake decoration reportedly caused the cut, she claimed.
""I told him if he ever did something like that to me I'd leave him,"" the bride wrote regarding her husband. ""He started laughing but I was being for real.""
The bride wrote that she felt that their wedding day had gone perfectly, but it was ruined when her husband scooped ""a huge chunk"" of wedding cake and smashed it onto her face. She claims she left the venue right away despite her husband’s and family’s attempts to get her to stay.
""This was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives and he embarrassed me in front of everyone for some prank that he knew I hated,"" the bride wrote. ""Not only that, he ruined a 500 dollar cake. He ruined my makeup, my hair and the top of my dress. The cake got all over.""
The bride asked Reddit users if her departure was an overreaction, but many seem to think she was in the right for leaving, according to the post’s 12,500 comments and 31,200 upvotes.
VIRAL MYTH ABOUT GUESTS WEARING RED TO WEDDINGS CARRIES SCANDALOUS MEANING, BUT IS IT TRUE?
""I think stunts like that are annulment-worthy, but that's just me,"" one Reddit user wrote.
""This isn't just a cake or a prank, this is flat out disrespect,"" another user wrote.
""He had one job and it was don’t smash a cake in his fiancée’s face,"" another commenter added.
""For most couples, trying to humiliate one another in an attempt to go viral on the one day they are supposed to be declaring their love in front of their friends and family is a giant red flag,"" Jodi Smith, an etiquette expert and coach at Mannersmith Etiquette Consulting in Massachusetts, told Fox News Digital. (iStock)
Dissenting commenters were largely downvoted, but some voiced that they think the bride shouldn’t have left the wedding venue.
""If all it takes is one cake to the face I don’t want to be there when things actually get tough,"" one Reddit user wrote.
SHOTGUN SHELL WEDDING PLACEHOLDERS THAT ARE UP FOR SALE ARE SHAMED ON REDDIT AS 'TACKY' AND 'TRASH'
""Why is everyone who comes here incapable of being a good sport,"" another user asked. ""Blew up your life because you couldn’t smash some cake back on his face?""
""Yeah [Original Poster] is over dramatic. Laugh it off talk and talk about it after the wedding,"" another user wrote.
Jodi Smith, an etiquette expert and coach at Mannersmith Etiquette Consulting in Marblehead, Massachusetts, told Fox News Digital that engaged couples should have ""many preemptive conversations"" about logistics and preferences before the big day.
""How to cut and feed the cake to each other is absolutely one of them,"" she said.
Engaged couples might want to discuss their cake cutting preferences if cake smashing is a tradition that concerns them. (iStock)
If both parties agree to smash cake onto each other’s faces, they can incorporate the tradition without issue because they have consented to do so as a couple, according to Smith.
People who try to surprise a partner with a cake smash put themselves at risk of upsetting their significant other and causing harm to their relationship, Smith warned.
BRIDE ASKS FRIEND TO MAKE WEDDING CAKE, IS THEN 'OFFENDED' WHEN QUESTIONED IF SHE'S PAYING FOR INGREDIENTS
""One’s wedding day should not be the time to ‘toughen’ up one’s brand-new spouse,"" she continued. ""For most couples, trying to humiliate one another in an attempt to go viral on the one day they are supposed to be declaring their love in front of their friends and family is a giant red flag.""
Smith warned that public and purposeful humiliation can be emotionally ""devastating"" to the recipient and contribute to a loss of trust.
Surprise cake smashing can upset a bride or groom, so spouses should exercise caution on their wedding day. (iStock)
Soiled wedding attire, accidental slips and falls and potential injury could happen when someone smashes cake onto another person’s face or pushes another person’s face into a cake, she noted.
""Rebuilding trust takes time,"" said Smith.
If a partner has upset their significant other with a cake smash, Smith said the offender should ""do some serious self-reflection"" and sincerely apologize.
NEWLYWEDS SHAMED BY SOCIAL MEDIA USERS FOR ADVERTISING VENMO USERNAME ON CAR WINDOW: 'WHY NOT?'
""Then, the victim can, with time, decide what needs to happen next,"" she said. ""For a public offense, a public apology might be appropriate. Rebuilding trust takes many small and genuinely respectful acts and behaviors before the damage can be repaired.""
Zoe Burke, of London, England, the leading wedding expert and editor at Hitched, an online wedding planning resource under The Knot Worldwide, told Fox News Digital that simple cake cutting ceremonies are more popular than cake smashing.
Smash-free cake-cutting ceremonies seem to be more popular than the cake-smashing tradition, but pranksters are still doing it, sometimes even for social media followers. Many TikTok users have also sounded off on the topic recently. (iStock)
She noted that the act of smashing wedding cakes onto spouses’ faces might be a declining because the ""average cost of a wedding"" has been ""increasing year-on-year"" with wedding cakes costing anywhere from $500 to $930 or more.
""[Cake smashing] might be something we start to see less of as couples look to really revel in their spend rather than smash it away,"" said Burke.
WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHERS SAY THERE ARE 3 SIGNS THAT A MARRIAGE WON'T LAST
At the same time, Burke has seen a rise in wedding day pranking as couples and wedding guests attempt to go viral on social media.
""If there were no cameras ready to capture things like the cake smash or trends with a similar theme, I believe they’d happen a lot less at weddings,"" she said.
Many newlyweds choose to document parts of their wedding day for social media. (iStock)
Burke said ""a consensual cake smash"" would be best for your guests to witness as opposed to an uncomfortable moment where the bride or groom gets upset, or even hurt as a result of the prank.

The origins of how smashing cake onto a spouse’s face became a wedding tradition aren’t clear or certain.
Wedding cake smashing seems to have evolved from myths. (iStock)
Many credit the Ancient Romans for the practice based on a longstanding rumor that claims newly-wedding couples used cake to reflect gender roles.

""In ancient Rome, crumbling a cake over the head of the bride by her husband was a way to enforce his dominance,"" said Burke, in reference to the myth.
Other sources suggest that cake crumbling, which could have evolved into cake smashing, was done to symbolize and ensure fertility.
Some folklorists also cite Medieval England as a possible source of inspiration for cake smashing.
""In medieval England it was tradition for the newlyweds to kiss for the first time over a pile of sweet buns,"" said Burke, who noted that many believe couples who kissed over a bun plate were guaranteed a fruitful future of wealth and happiness.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/army-veteran-says-faith-god-saved-life-12-suicide-attempts-something-stronger-myself","Army veteran says faith in God saved his life after 12 suicide attempts: 'Something stronger than myself'","USMC veteran and double amputee Josh Bleill shares how the organization helped him after his military service.
This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
An Army veteran told Fox News Digital he is here today due to his unwavering faith in God.
JP Lane, a Purple Heart veteran as well as an author, singer and speaker based in San Antonio, Texas, endured the worst after he faced serious injuries while he was deployed in Afghanistan in 2010.
While covering ground clearance, which involved searching for explosives, Lane was blown up three separate times, he shared in an interview.
AI TECH IDENTIFIES SUICIDE RISK IN MILITARY VETERANS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE: ‘FLIPPING THE MODEL’
But on July 2, 2011, Lane’s third and final encounter with an explosive would change his life forever.
""Ultimately, it was the first truck of mine … to be penetrated by an IED,"" he said.
Lane shared he first decided to join the military as a middle schooler after watching the 9/11 terrorist attacks. (Semper Fi & America's Fund)
""And when it went through my vehicle, it actually amputated both of my legs, snapped my left femur in half, my pelvis snapped in half, dislocated my spine and my pelvis, and my right arm snapped in half 90 degrees.""
He went on, ""My right middle finger was amputated immediately. But that's OK. Nobody needs that finger anyway,"" he said jokingly.
""And everything inside my torso was destroyed except for my heart and my left lung.""

Lane was immediately airlifted to the hospital — where he was ""having a hard time staying alive.""
Eventually, he was transferred back to the U.S. to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. A month and a half later, he woke up from a coma.
The destroyed RG-31 vehicle caught in the IED blast in Afghanistan with JP Lane is pictured here. (Semper Fi & America's Fund)
Upon waking up and realizing both of his legs were gone, Lane questioned what his life had in store for him.
""I didn't know what was next,"" he said. ""It was very difficult to wake up and to see that I no longer would be able to enjoy the things that I used to be able to do, like play drums, run, wakeboard or snowboard — you name it.""
He added, ""Everything that I used to enjoy with my legs was now an impossible feat.""
VET WHO LOST MILITARY ‘BROTHERS’ TO POST-WAR SUICIDE CALLS FOR URGENT CHANGE: ‘WE COULD DO BETTER’
This realization took a toll on Lane’s mental health, as he faced his new diagnosis of PTSD, he said.
He said he struggled with the prospect of finding love as ""half a dude"" after he separated from his wife at the time.
Lane is shown in the hospital after he suffered severe injuries after being blown up by an IED in Afghanistan in July 2011. (Semper Fi & America's Fund)
""How am I going to get up and start living life with joy and happiness if I’m literally deteriorating day by day mentally?"" he said he wondered back then.
These negative thoughts were so incessant that the veteran said he attempted to take his own life 12 separate times.
""Most of those attempts were in the Fisher House, when I was by myself going through therapy and seeing everybody else with their family members and trying to get through it,"" he said.

""But they weren't happy with their situations, either,"" he added. ""Everybody was in pain all the time, and it was just very, very difficult.""
After his 12th suicide attempt, Lane had a realization that he could not fight the battle alone.
""It was a roller coaster ride of emotions,"" Lane said. ""But I relied on my faith and my family and my battle buddies to encourage me and give me the strength to get through all of it."" (Semper Fi & America's Fund)
""That's when I started to rely on my faith to get me through it all,"" he said. ""Because as strong as I thought I was, mentally and physically … I realized that I wasn't strong enough to do this on my own.""
Added Lane, ""I had to reach out and rely on something stronger than myself, which is why I went back to my faith in God, [which gave] me the strength to get through it all, allowing me to have real joy in the darkest moments of my life.""
Lane said his faith in God has enabled him to find ""real joy in the darkest moments.""
Lane said he is ""very grateful"" for his ability to rely on his faith to achieve physical and mental recovery, which became apparent to other soldiers.
He said the best remedy for other soldiers, and even civilians, who are struggling with mental health is to connect with others.
JP Lane holds up a T-shirt with the saying, ""Nice try Taliban,"" while on a visit to Afghanistan in 2018. (Semper Fi & America's Fund)
""I didn’t do this by myself,"" he said.
After his final suicide attempt, Lane said a thought popped into his head that made him ""so glad"" he didn’t take his own life.
""That thought was, ‘Do we go to a war zone with just one soldier?’"" he said.
US MARINE CORPS VETERAN WHO LOST LEGS IN AFGHANISTAN SAYS A NONPROFIT HELPED HIM STAY ALIVE
""Well, obviously not. One soldier can't handle a battle,"" he went on. ""So why would I go through a mental war zone with just one soldier? It doesn't make any sense … We're not designed and made to be on this earth and live life by ourselves. We have to reach out.""
For Lane, that outreach included getting involved with the nonprofit organization Semper Fi & America’s Fund, which graciously provided the soldier with what he needed.
Semper Fi & America's Fund provided $4.8 million in basic needs assistance to combat-wounded veterans in 2022. (Semper Fi & America's Fund)
""I knew that was an organization that I could call on whenever I needed any assistance or help,"" he said. ""They’re [like] family members, ready to be there.""
He said further, ""It's literally one of the best organizations on the planet.""
Since overcoming his internal struggle, Lane went on to find great success in multiple facets of his new life.
ON PTSD AWARENESS DAY, IMPORTANT HELP FOR VETERANS, MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS IN SEARCH OF BETTER SLEEP
After learning how to walk again with prosthetic legs, Lane set the record for the fastest double amputee to be in and out of therapy — finishing in only six months.
""It was definitely motivation to get out and start living and enjoying life again,"" he said.
JP Lane is pictured with his wife, Crystal, on the couple's wedding day in February 2018. Today, Lane has a hefty following on TikTok, as more than 840,000 people tune in to his content about his life as a double amputee and a loving husband. (Semper Fi & America's Fund)
Lane has since pursued his career in music and has performed at the inaugurations of both President Obama and President Trump.
Aside from performing and public speaking, Lane has grown a hefty following on TikTok, with more than 840,000 people tuning in to his content about life as a double amputee and a loving husband.
""I turned to God, and I was like, ‘Hey, I'm done with this. It's your turn to handle it.'""
He hopes that his videos inspire people to ""never give up and never surrender,"" he said.
""My wife and I know that this is a very dark world that we live in,"" he said. ""And we just want to continue to be the light in a very dark situation.""
""We just have a good time doing it, too, because it provides that other source of purpose to continue to be here and help others get through whatever they're going through,"" Lane added.
Veterans Affairs data indicates that vets are 1.5 times more likely to commit suicide than civilians — with an average of 17 veteran suicide deaths per day in the U.S.

As National Suicide Prevention Month puts a spotlight on these numbers, Lane suggests one way to remedy these jarring rates is to trust in a higher good.
""I turned to God, and I was like, ‘Hey, I'm done with this. It's your turn to handle it,’"" he said.
JP Lane performed the National Anthem at a Spurs game in San Antonio, Texas, on April 20, 2019. (Semper Fi & America's Fund)
""And He literally took my whole entire life and flipped it and changed for the better, and I am so grateful that I didn't rely on my own strength, because I was not able to handle this.""
Said Lane, ""Legs or no legs, I still have a purpose on this earth, just like each and every one of you has a purpose on this earth.""

Now that the U.S. Senate has dropped its dress code requirement — sparking controversy and even criticism from those who have suggested the move was done to appease Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who dislikes suits — etiquette experts have been weighing in on the development.
Senators now will be allowed to wear clothing of their choice.
However, others who enter the chamber must comply with the dress code — which is coats and ties for men and business attire for women, as Fox News Digital previously reported.
FLORIDA-BASED ETIQEUTTE EXPERT REVEALS 40 TIPS FOR A BETTER LIFE
""First, I’d like to ask Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to define ‘relaxed and casual attire,’"" said Jacqueline Whitmore, a Florida-based etiquette consultant, to Fox News Digital this week about Schumer's change to the dress code in the Senate chamber.
Whitmore went on, ""Does that mean jeans, shorts, gym clothes — or all of the above?""

She also said, ""A dress code of any kind needs to be clearly defined so there are no violations or gray areas.""
The etiquette expert has advised individuals as well as companies and organizations for decades about a range of situations that need navigating. She founded The Protocol School of Palm Beach, a coaching and training company.

Whitmore also said, ""To allow senators to dress casually but to require all others who work on the Senate floor to conform to a more formal dress code seems unfair and unjust.""

She also told Fox News Digital, ""Businesses have been moving away from business attire since the ‘80s, starting with ’casual Fridays.'""
As a result, ""standards have gotten worse and worse, especially since the pandemic,"" she said.
""Dressing well shows respect for yourself and for the people you serve.""
Whitmore added, ""I always tell my corporate clients, ‘Dress for your clients’ comfort, not your own.'""
She added, ""Dressing well shows respect for yourself and for the people you serve.""

Schumer said early this week that staff for the chamber’s sergeant-at-arms — the Senate’s official clothes police — will no longer enforce a dress code on the Senate floor, the Associated Press reported.
Speaking on the Fox Business Network on Monday, Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tennessee, said, ""It’s just another step in the movement by the Democrats to transform America, to take us to a place that is much less respectful than we historically have been.""
Bob Bostock, a former Senate staffer, told Fox News Digital in an emailed comment, ""Although the dress code has been relaxed for senators, I would hope that every senator — every one — would have enough respect for the institution to dress in a way that honors the history, tradition and sanctity of the Senate chamber.""

Chad Pergram, senior congressional correspondent for Fox News, confirmed on Sunday the Senate will no longer enforce a dress code for senators. ""Senators can now [wear] whatever they want,"" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter). ""However, others entering the chamber must comply with the dress code. Coats/ties for men. Business attire for women.""

In comments shared online, people have been weighing in on the developments.
""I think they should remember who they work for.""
Wrote one person in response to a story posted on Monday about the rules change, ""A sad new trend that when you are unable to maintain compliance to a rule or law then the option becomes to stop trying to enforce it.""

Said another individual online, expressing a personal opinion, ""Fetterman isn't asking to dress that way for medical or religious or some other understandable reasons. It's purely due to his lack of respect for his position and failure to take his responsibility seriously.""
Someone else wrote, ""If the Senate has no respect for itself, why should the American people respect it?""

On Facebook, one commenter shared, ""Rules for thee, but not for me. Dress code for everyone in the building except for themselves. I think they should remember WHO they work for.""
Someone else wrote, ""Pray for the culture.""
Fox News Digital reached out to Sen. Schumer's office for comment but did not hear back by publication time.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Pass the ""garbage,"" please.
It's not pilfered trash on a plate, but rather Rochester, New York’s iconic culinary invention.
The comfort food staple dates back to the early 20th century and remains a celebrated favorite on Rochester’s food landscape to this day, combining a medley of hot dogs or hamburgers, home fries, macaroni salad and meat hot sauce, plus accouterments like mustard, ketchup and onions.
ENGAGEMENT CHICKEN: THE DISH WOMEN MAKE TO CAST A 'SPELL' WHEN THEY HOPE TO MARRY
If you're hoping for the dish to be even more indulgent, it’s often served with buttered bread slices.
Beloved by college pupils as a late-night feast as students have returned to school, it may be time to dive into the meal’s backstory and how to make this rich, protein-filled pile.
Rochester, New York, is known for a delicious and trashy dish called the Garbage Plate, most loved by college students returning to classes. (Visit Rochester/Brave World Media)
The Garbage Plate’s origins date back to 1918, when the restaurant Nick Tahou Hots founded by namesake Nick Tahou created the fabled fare, according to Visit Rochester, the official tourism board for Rochester and surrounding Monroe County.

It’s worth highlighting that Nick Tahou Hots has a trademark on the name ""Garbage Plate,"" so the only genuine Garbage Plate can be found at this establishment.
There are different versions of the Garbage Plate throughout Rochester. (Visit Rochester/Brave World Media)
Still, the concoction is readily available in these parts, with many restaurants across the greater Rochester area offering versions under names like ""Trash Plate"" or ""Rochester Plate,"" among others.
An article on VisitRochester.com shares more on the history of the Garbage Plate as well as a list of places around Rochester where you can find different versions of the dish.
Some local eateries have even taken to creating playful riffs on the original Garbage Plate, such as the vegan Compost Plate at Red Fern and the Sushi Plate at Stingray Fusion.

Currently, Nick Tahou Hots is in its third generation of ownership.
Visit Rochester revealed to Fox News Digital how anyone can make their own version of the Garbage Plate at home.
Bear in mind that while such platters are traditionally a combination of the below ingredients, it’s by no means a definitive recipe, as many variations are on offer.

A traditional Rochester meat hot sauce is described by Don Bush, owner of Marshall Street Bar & Grill, as ""a bean-less Texas Chili — the recipe has most of the same components but less tomato. Traditional meat sauce is a combination of ground beef, spices and tomatoes.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/ai-powered-bird-feeder-candid-pics-birds-identifies-friends-snack","AI-powered bird feeder takes candid pics, identifies our feathered friends as they snack","Birda co-founders John and Natalie White shared details of their social birding network with Fox News Digital.
There’s a new, high-tech way of bird feeding (and watching).
An AI-powered bird feeder called Bird Buddy doesn’t only feed the birds — it takes candid photos and identifies the species of each bird as it lands for a snack.
Bird Buddy CEO Franci Zidar, whose company is based in Kalamazoo, Michigan, told Fox News Digital that the product uses artificial intelligence technology to take clear and ""interesting"" snapshots of the birds that come to feed.
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
Bird Buddy's AI first detects when a bird lands — and captures a clear photo.
The smart bird feeder then detects the type of bird species — and sends a notification with the photo and bird info to its owner’s mobile device.

""For each bird that we identify, we have a custom-built profile that's a really beautiful mix of fun and educational information,"" Zidar said.
""You get to learn about the kind of foods the birds like, and how they sing, so you can recognize them when you're out and about — and [it is designed to] lower the friction for people to enter this kind of bird-watching world.""
QUIZ: NAME THAT BIRD! CAN YOU MATCH THESE BEAUTIFUL BIRDS WITH THEIR CORRECT NAMES?
Bird Buddy also runs a live network that displays captured images in an online, real-time feed.
Zidar and his team, including an in-house ornithologist, built the AI model by planting hundreds of global cameras to collect data on various bird species.
A house finch snatches a seed from a Bird Buddy smart feeder. (Bird Buddy)
Based on that data, the model has since been developed to have a ""really high rate of recognition,"" he said.
Bird Buddy’s learning model has grown a ""huge data set,"" as more than a million detections occur around the world each day.
""Roughly 70 million people in the U.S. feed birds around their homes.""
Zidar, who is baed in Slovenia, shared that he's long been creating products that ""gamify the outdoors,"" including collaborative work with Snapchat.

Now, with Bird Buddy, Zidar said his vision is to reconnect people with nature, given that bird feeding is the second-largest outdoor hobby in the U.S.
""Roughly 70 million people in the U.S. feed birds around their homes,"" he said. ""It’s second only to gardening.""
Some other sources indicate that birdwatching is among the top 10 favorite outdoor activities for people in the U.S.
Bird Buddy’s AI can detect what kind of bird lands on the feeder and sends a notification with a photo and species info to its owner’s mobile device. (Bird Buddy)
Zidar broke down the multi-level impact of Bird Buddy, including the use of bird detection data, which can analyze bird migration and other important research that’s crucial to protecting the animal.
APP FOR BIRD LOVERS GETS PEOPLE OUT INTO NATURE WHILE HELPING BIRD, WILDLIFE CONSERVATION
The CEO revealed that the future of Bird Buddy’s technology could lead to identifying specific birds that interact with the cameras, allowing watchers and researchers to keep track of individual birds without having to physically tag them.
Bird Buddy CEO Franci Zidar, pictured here, shared with Fox News Digital that the product uses AI technology to take clear and ""interesting"" snapshots of the birds that come to feed. (Bird Buddy)
""It also gives meaning to entering the Bird Buddy network,"" he said.
""You're not just a customer and a user — you're also contributing to this large data set and the cause behind it.""
And Bird Buddy’s network is about to expand with the launch of its newest initiative, Bird Buddy Explore, which will allow anyone — with or without a smart feeder — to access feeders in 30 remote locations around the world.

These include exotic destinations such as Ghana, Hawaii, Chile and Kenya, where cameras can be accessed through the Bird Buddy app for free.
The 150,000 community feeders will also be able to share content.
Bird feeding is the second-biggest outdoor hobby in the U.S., according to Zidar of Bird Buddy. In some other lists, the activity is among the top 10 most popular outdoor activities.  (Bird Buddy)
""It's one of those notifications that won't be stressful, anxiety-inducing or annoying, because it's going to be a beautiful picture of a bird,"" he said.
""Everybody will now be able to connect to this broad network of Bird Buddies from these beautiful places and effectively enjoy content beyond their backyard.""

While Bird Buddy began with a mission of adding birds to a collection, Zidar said it's blossomed into fostering a connection with nature and promoting mental health.
Research shows that people who are ""more connected with nature are usually happier in life,"" according to the U.K. Mental Health Foundation.

""Nature connectedness is also associated with lower levels of poor mental health, particularly lower depression and anxiety,"" the foundation wrote on its website.
Feeding birds is a way of contributing to environmental protection, said Zidar.
Bird feeding as an activity is an easy way to ""give something back to nature,"" he noted.

Bird Buddy recently announced two new accessories for its feeders, including the Bird Buddy Perch Extender and Bird Buddy 3-in-1 Nutrition Set.
The latter includes a water fountain, jelly tray and fruit spike, according to a press release.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/washington-fisherman-catches-massive-record-breaking-mahi-mahi-prayed-for-that","Washington fisherman catches massive record-breaking mahi mahi: 'Prayed for that'","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A Washington angler caught a winner after reeling in a fish that is like ""winning the lottery.""
Wade La Fontaine, from Camino Island, said he decided to join a charter boat when he was told two extra seats were available late last month.
""It was a really nice day on the way. [The] bar crossing was great,"" La Fontaine told Fox News Digital.
NORTH CAROLINA ANGLERS GO SWORDFISHING, INSTEAD CATCH RARE SPECIES: 'PREHISTORIC, ALMOST'
""[As] soon as we got into about, I don't know, I guess it was about five or six thousand feet of depth, the weather started to pick up and it was starting white cap. It was probably 15 mph winds,"" he added.

At that point in the trip, Fontaine and the rest of the crew on board had caught three tuna.
Hours had passed before anyone saw movement on the lines that had been set — but the wait appeared to be worth it.
FLORIDA RESEARCHERS OFFERING $50 TO FISHERMEN WHO CATCH THIS SPECIES OF FISH
Fontaine was right beside the rod that went off, and he knew he had to act quickly, he said.
""To get one of those exotic species, I prayed for that for 10 years.""
""You've got to be on [the rod] really quick to get from a transition to a troll to live bait,"" Fontaine shared as he described the process of catching a tuna.
""You have basically 20 or 30 seconds to get a live bait rod in the water and you've got to get all those other rods that you were trolling with out of the water,"" he added.
Fontaine said that when he looked into the water to see what he had caught, he saw something white with blue speckles.

He immediately notified the rest of the team that it was not a tuna and everyone started ""to freak out,"" he recalled.
Fontaine was out on a charter in hopes of reeling in some tuna, but was left in amazement when he reeled in the exotic fish.  (Wade La Fontaine)
As Fontaine and the captain, Kevin Johnson, pulled the fish aboard, the entire charter crew couldn't stop screaming after realizing what it was they had caught — an exotic mahi mahi.
""To get one of those exotic species, I prayed for that for 10 years,"" Fontaine commented.
SOUTH CAROLINA TEEN FISHES FOR CATFISH FOR THE FIRST TIME, REELS IN 'EXTREMELY RARE' FIND
""It was truly something I never thought would happen,"" he continued.
Fontaine (left) never imagined he would catch an exotic fish this far up north, let alone set the new state record in Washington. He is pictured with Darrell Johnson, owner of Far Corners Fishing Charters (center) and Captain Keith Johnson (right). (Wade La Fontaine)
Captain Keith Johnson of Far Corners Fishing Charters had a feeling the fish was large enough to have surpassed the previous Washington state record for mahi mahi, Fontaine shared.
Johnson reached out to has wife as the crew was on their way back to the shore, asking her for information about the former record which stood at 16.27 pounds, according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW)

Fontaine said he thought his catch was close to 20 pounds, but he had to wait until he made it to the dock and weigh the massive fish.
""I was just really lucky to be there at that rod.""
Once Fontaine and his crew of six made it back to the dock, they had to search for a certified scale to weigh the fish.
He eventually found a scale that fit the specificities of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife requirements, and a WDFW fish program biologist joined the angler to take a look at the mahi mahi.
""Every minute that it is dead and on ice, [the fish] is losing weight, so you've got to be pretty quick on it,"" Fontaine noted.

A large group started to gather at the dock and eagerly waited to see the fish because it does not happen often, he continued.
Nearly 42 miles off the coast of Washington, Fontaine caught the exotic mahi mahi and set the new state record  (Wade La Fontaine)
The WDFW reported that Fontaine had caught a 21 pound, 48-inch-long mahi mahi nearly 42 miles off the coast of Washington on Aug. 25.
Fontaine believes the after effects of tropical storm Hilary played a large role in brining the warm water current further north which may have brought in the exotic fish.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/its-big-lie-max-lucado-pastor-author-admits-startling-truth-those-appear-perfect","'It's a big lie': Max Lucado, pastor and author, admits the startling truth about those who appear 'perfect'","Author of ‘Help is Here’ Pastor Max Lucado shares the message behind his new book and discusses finding strength during stressful times.
Speaking by phone to Fox News Digital just as his newest book was published, Pastor Max Lucado of Texas revealed that some of the strongest and most successful people today in any field or endeavor are those who admit their faults and failings — because ""we are all saved by the same grace. We are all loved by the same God.""
Lucado's latest book, ""God Never Gives Up on You,"" takes readers through an understanding of strength through weakness, of dignity through a deliberate decision to admit imperfections and to seek understanding and renewal.
It's very hard for many people to go down that path — for reasons of pride, insecurity, immaturity, a lack of self-awareness and more, he acknowledged. But Lucado stressed the gift of healing that's available.
AS SUICIDE RATES INCREASE, FAITH LEADER REVEALS 3 KEY POINTS, NOTING, ‘HOPE IS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE’
It's by acknowledging imperfections and weaknesses, he said, that people can be ""healthier"" — spiritually, physically, emotionally and psychologically.
The subtitle of his book is ""What Jacob's Story Teaches Us About Grace, Mercy and God's Relentless Love"" (Thomas Nelson, Sept. 2023).
Max Lucado, pastor and bestselling author who is based in Texas, shared with Fox News Digital in an interview how everyone can be ""healthier"" — as long as they agree to do one thing in life. (Max Lucado )
Said Lucado, ""Welcome to the human race. Nobody bats 1,000. And the sooner we can acknowledge that we don't, the healthier we'll be.""
He added, ""I think the heaviest load to carry is the load of trying to appear perfect — this idea that ‘I’ve got to appear like I have it all together.' That's exhausting. It's exhausting. It's depleting. And also it keeps us from getting the help and the healing that we need.""
MAX LUCADO: I WAS CALLED ’AMERICA'S PASTOR' BUT IT DIDN'T REVEAL THE TRUTH
He went on, ""A healthier posture is to say, ‘Hey, I need help. I need help.’ The Bible says to confess your sins to one another so that healing may come. There's a connection between confession and healing. And so the sooner we can acknowledge that we need help, the sooner we'll receive help.""
""Perfection is not a virtue. Imperfection is an impossibility.""
So why is this so hard for so many people to admit?
""I think that we've been taught that perfection is a virtue,"" said Lucado. ""That the best people have no weakness.""
Continued Lucado, ""That's a lie. That's a big lie. Perfection is not a virtue. Imperfection is an impossibility.""
Instead, he said, ""honesty is a virtue. Vulnerability is a virtue. And so, the AA people — they got it right. They got it right! You know — ‘Hi, I’m Max. I'm a drunk.' Or, 'Hi, I'm Max, I'm addicted to painkillers.' And to be able to acknowledge [an imperfection, a fault, a failing], right off the bat — there's just beauty in that. There's brilliance in that. And there's potential for healing in that.""
As pastor and author Max Lucado told Fox News Digital in an interview, there is ""beauty"" and ""brilliance"" in admitting weaknesses to others — and ""the potential for healing,"" too, he said. His new book is ""God Never Gives Up on You"" (Thomas Nelson, 2023).  (Max Lucado/iStock)
Lucado, a father and grandfather, is pastor at Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas. He's sold over 145 million books worldwide.
Here's more of Fox News Digital's interview with Pastor Lucado as he continues to travel the country discussing his latest book, already a bestseller — and as of publication time, a No. 1 bestseller in the Old Testament Bible Study category on Amazon as well as the No. 3 bestseller for Christian Inspirational titles.
Fox News Digital: In your view, do other people respect those who admit their faults and failings? Or do people, especially in professional settings, then see those who admit their weaknesses differently?
Pastor Max Lucado: Yes, they do respect those who [admit their imperfections]. In my world, as a pastor — and I've been a pastor since 1979, which is kind of before Noah — there are many pastors [and other faith leaders] who tend to want to appear like they have it all together. The ones who have successful careers are the ones who give up on that early.
WASHINGTON PASTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THE PAIN OF PUTDOWNS AGAINST THE CHRISTIAN FAITH: ‘ASK GOD FOR COURAGE’
They get down off the pedestal … They don't insist that they're perceived as different.
The healthier ones are those who say, ""I'm a fellow struggler. We're all saved by the same grace. We're all loved by the same God.""
And so, I see the ones who have longevity are those who acknowledge their weaknesses — it's just a healthier posture to have. And I have a hunch that is true in every profession.
Said Pastor Max Lucado to Fox News Digital, ""COVID did a lot of things to us, but one thing it did is it insulated us. It created a fear of others — and it caused us to cocoon, to hibernate. We are community-minded people. We need to shake hands. We need to hug. We need to talk. We need to sit across the table from each other.""  (Max Lucado )
Fox News Digital: Can you discuss the difficulties and challenges that arose for so many millions of people during the COVID lockdowns — and that still exist for many in new and different ways in 2023?
ML: COVID did a lot of things to us, but one thing it did is it insulated us. It created a fear of others — and it caused us to cocoon, to hibernate. We are community-minded people. We need to shake hands. We need to hug. We need to talk. We need to sit across the table from each other.
SURPRISE! TALKING WITH OTHERS IN PERSON BOOSTS MOOD MORE THAN TEXTING, SCROLLING OR BEING ALONE, STUDY SAYS
And for 18 months or two years — we were told not to do that.
We were told not to gather in public places.
""The damage of COVID is that it created a new habit of separating ourselves from others and maybe even a distrust of others.""
And that takes its toll on us because we are cultural people. We like to go to football games, operas, musicals. We like to sing together, laugh together, be together — we enjoyed the privacy for a bit, but after awhile it took its toll on us.
So I think the damage of COVID is that it created a new habit of separating ourselves from others and maybe even a distrust of others. I don't think we're quite out of that.
These are fear-based. We were told, ""Other people will breathe bacteria on you, and you could die."" And so we became afraid of people.
And we began walking wide circles around people and avoiding them in the grocery stores or in social gatherings or even inviting people over for meals. Because we were afraid — especially the vulnerable, the fragile, the elderly, or those who were already sick. And they needed community — and yet they were told that the couldn't have it.
Pastor Lucado encouraged people to begin to make their way back into their church's embrace in post-COVID times if they haven't already. ""Maybe I would say to [the] person [who may be struggling in that regard], 'Let's start somewhere. Why don't you come to my office and let's just talk.' Or, I might ask the person, 'Who do you trust? Who do you know? Surely you know someone who doesn't have COVID. Why don't the two of you meet and have a cup of coffee.'""  (Max Lucado/iStock)
And now it takes a while for them to get the courage back.
Fox News Digital: What do you say to those who may still be struggling in that regard — including those who maybe don't want to step foot inside a church or community center again after what happened?
ML: I think people can take baby steps, you know? If that person were sitting with me in the office — or they may not even want to be sitting in the office with me! So we may need to have a visit over the phone. But maybe I would say to that person, ""Let's start somewhere. Why don't you come to my office and let's just talk."" Or, I might ask them, ""Who do you trust? Who do you know? Surely you know someone who doesn't have COVID. Why don't the two of you meet and have a cup of coffee.""
""It's just like any fear. We can overcome it one step at a time.""
And little by little, people can re-engage with each other and with society.
And I think it's just like any fear. We can overcome it one step at a time.
THE LORD IS ‘THE ORIENTING CENTER OF OUR LIVES,’ SAYS MASSACHUSETTS FAITH LEADER: ‘WE CAN BE BOLD’
It just may be too much for them to come back into a church building. But maybe they could gather with a small group in a home Bible study, or have a priest come over to their home and bring them Communion. They can reach out to a local church and ask for some arrangements, even meet in a park — there are different ways to do this.
Fox News Digital: We know about the decline today in church attendance, especially among young people. What are your thoughts on this issue and how to address it?
ML: I don't react with great concern on this. I would say that societies ebb and flow in terms of spirituality and with people's engagement in church.

I think that we live in a secular society — and matters of faith are not taught to our children by leaders in positions of authority. And some are even told not to talk about their faith. So this is a natural outgrowth of that.
But what is happening that is positive today is that as the statistics show people who have less faith, then those who do have faith have a deeper faith. It's not the ""in"" thing — it's not the current trend to be a person of faith. So if you do have faith, it's a robust faith.

In our church here in San Antonio, we've enjoyed an increase in church attendance — and we're seeing a lot of 18-year-olds, 19-year-olds, 20-year-olds, 21-year-olds in our church.
And they are rocking and rolling in matters of faith! The reason is, they have to own it.

Their peer groups ar probably not urging them to practice a certain level of morality and spirituality. But once they own it — they become disciples. They take it seriously.
So overall, I'm terribly concerned. And if the Lord carries, we'll have another revival.
And maybe it's time to let our faith become more authentic.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/surprise-talking-others-person-boosts-mood-more-texting-scrolling-being-alone-study-says","Surprise! Talking with others in person boosts mood more than texting, scrolling or being alone, study says","Mother and neuropsychologist Dr. Jennifer Reesman discusses the consequences of longer screen time for teenagers and what parents can do to help their child's mental health struggles.
Talking to another person, even if that person is a stranger, boosts people's mood more than engaging in screen time or spending time sitting quietly alone, a new study found.
Researchers from the University of Georgia's Franklin College of Arts and Sciences also discovered that even if a chat with others boosted people's mood more, they had originally assumed they'd get more enjoyment out of scrolling on their phones.
Doctoral student and lead author Christina Leckfor said, ""When people are out in the real world, they have these options,"" according to UGA Today, a news site at the University of Georgia.
7 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHANGES THAT COULD REDUCE RISK OF DEPRESSION, SAYS STUDY: ‘ENORMOUS BENEFITS’
""We were interested in getting a sense of how people compare their options — both in terms of how they expect to feel and then how they actually feel after doing these things,"" she also said, according to the site.
To understand those perceptions, researchers separated study participants into four groups.
""We thought people might underestimate how much they would enjoy talking to a stranger and overestimate how much they would enjoy using their smartphones,"" said the lead researcher of a new study.  (Cyberguy.com)
Two groups predicted how they would feel about different actions — and two groups completed the assigned actions.
All groups then ranked the options from most to least enjoyable to rate how likely they were to experience a corresponding positive or negative emotion.

Said Leckfor, ""We thought people might underestimate how much they would enjoy talking to a stranger and overestimate how much they would enjoy using their smartphones,"" according to a release on the UGA.edu site.
""Conversations with others increased positive emotions by about five points.""
""But that’s not what we found. Across our studies, people were actually more accurate in predicting how they would feel than we thought they’d be.""
When given three options — using a smartphone, sitting alone or talking to a stranger — the conversation with the other person held the ""highest positive emotional value"" in both groups.
Using a smartphone came in second — while sitting alone came in third.

But when given specific smartphone tasks such as watching videos, scrolling through social media or texting, in addition to talking to others or sitting quietly, participants said they would enjoy watching videos the most.
This was followed by talking to a stranger, using social media and then texting.
TEEN SCREEN TIME MORE THAN DOUBLED DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC, STUDY SAYS
Sitting alone once again ranked last.
""This could mean that people don’t always recognize the potential benefits of a conversation, or they’re not prioritizing that information.""
From an average baseline of 52.2 out of 100, conversations with others increased positive emotions by about five points to 57.68.
By comparison, watching videos gave a 2.4-point bump to 54.62 — while texting resulted in a drop to 47.56.
Said Leckfor, ""It surprised us that even though participants reported an improved mood after talking to a stranger, they still ranked texting above talking to a stranger.""
""This study taps into the idea that maybe we are better at understanding how we feel about different activities if we take the time to give them conscious thought,"" said the lead researcher of a new study.  (iStock)
She added, ""This could mean that people don’t always recognize the potential benefits of a conversation, or they’re not prioritizing that information,"" according to the UGA site.
""It also shows that just experiencing something as enjoyable isn’t always enough to get us to want to do it,"" she also said.

The study was published in the Journal of Social Psychology.
The results highlight the importance of giving some thought to the intention behind picking up a smartphone before doing so, the researchers said.
A new study ""shows that just experiencing something as enjoyable isn’t always enough to get us to want to do it,"" according to a doctoral student and lead author of the study at the University of Georgia.  (iStock)
Leckfor concluded, ""In the real world, we’re not always consciously making these comparisons, even if you have all of these choices.""

It’s the world’s largest desert — and the highest, the windiest and the least populated continent.
Expect the unexpected when cruising Antarctica.
To be sure, it will be quite different from your favorite beach destination.

Cold, harsh, and breathtakingly beautiful, it offers an amazing glimpse at the life of penguins who appear to be stuck in the Ice Age.
So, what is it like going there?
This writer traveled there recently — and is privileged to share observations and insights.
""The captain told us to put away all freestanding belongings in our cabins in preparation for rough waters."" (Danuta Hamlin/Fox News)
‘ANTARCTICA: THE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST’
I have no fear . . . I have no dread.
Of that marked day that lies ahead.
My flesh will turn to ash and clay ...
The captain recited a morbid poem over the loudspeaker — then told us to put away all freestanding belongings in our cabins in preparation for rough waters.
We had been at sea for a few days already.
Our journey began in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which allowed us to enjoy warm weather and the lovely port of Montevideo, Uruguay.
TO RAISE MILLIONS FOR CANCER CHARITIES, ONE CEO WILL TREK ACROSS THE SOUTH POLE: ‘A RISK WORTH TAKING’
But by the time we reached the Falkland Islands the wind picked up, and the tide grew too high to use the little tender boats to visit Port Stanley.
The captain decided to bypass the Falklands altogether and sailed the ship straight into the notorious Drake Passage.

It was a calm evening, however, so we went to bed convinced that the Norwegian Captain ever so slightly exaggerated the menace of the Drake.
The passage, named after 16th century English explorer Sir Francis Drake, is considered one of the most treacherous voyages for ships to make.
It's a turbulent body of water between Cape Horn and the South Shetland Islands, where the Pacific and Atlantic oceans collide with unforgiving force.
ANTARCTIC ICE LOSS LIKELY WIPES OUT 4 COLONIES' WORTH OF EMPEROR PENGUIN CHICKS, RESEARCHERS SAY
We discovered what it all really meant around 2 a.m. when a glass filled with water flew off the nightstand in our stateroom.
Books and cell phones followed, crashing to the floor.

I jumped out of bed to put things in order just to find the ship swaying like crazy and all my organs seeming to shift inside my body in all sorts of directions.
To be on the safe side, we popped anti-nausea pills — which tend to work well when taken before one becomes seasick — and crawled back into bed.
With short intervals to fetch food and take more pills, we remained put and watched movies.
Twenty-four hours later, the coast was clear ... and we could feel the chilly air and the excitement of approaching the Antarctic Peninsula.

We were sailing aboard Seabourn Quest, a vessel reinforced for the Antarctic ice and adventures.
ICEBERG LARGER THAN LONDON BREAKS OFF ANTARCTICA ICE SHELF
Since it was an expedition cruise, we were divided into exploration groups.
We had to attend daily lectures to familiarize ourselves with rules, regulations and all kinds of amazing things related to the seventh continent.

We were still some distance away when during one such lecture we heard a booming voice: ""Iceberg on the port side.""
Now, who in their right mind would not want to see the first iceberg?
We all jumped to our feet and hurried in the direction indicated by the captain.
The iceberg turned out to be quite small, nothing to write home about — but the captain blasted out again, telling us that we could not all congregate on just one side of the ship.
We didn’t want the vessel to tip over, so everyone dispersed.

Soon enough, we were facing the majestic Antarctica.
MASSIVE WAVES BOMBARD DRAKE PASSAGE CRUISE SHIPS IN VIRAL VIDEOS: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT ANTARCTICA CRUISES
We were all in awe of its incredible beauty: the whiteness of the snow, the turquoise-colored ice, the seals basking in the summer sun, the pristine, clear air, the unapproachable, hostile cliffs, the absolute silence … and the penguins traveling on icebergs.
Adelie penguins are shown traveling on an iceberg in Antarctica.  (Danuta Hamlin/Fox News)
There are no ports in the Antarctic Peninsula — zodiac pontoon boats take tourists to the land, and everyone disembarks either directly onto ice or into the water.
Long rubber boots are issued to passengers, and drinking coffee before disembarkation is not recommended.
The attraction is the frozen land and its residents — mainly the penguins.
There are no restrooms available, no real commerce ... just some old bases for explorers turned into museums, and an Argentinian settlement called Esperanza Base.
The attraction is the frozen land and its residents — mainly the penguins.
During our expedition we encountered three different species: Chinstraps, Adelines and Gentoos.
Gentoo penguins are pictured up close in Antarctica. (Danuta Hamlin/Fox News)
The penguins appeared to be at ease with visitors, going about their daily business, hardly paying any attention to humans.
The expert expedition crew members made sure everyone’s boots were disinfected, and no bacteria made its way from the ship to the land.
We even had our clothes inspected.
Any feeding of wildlife is strictly prohibited in Antarctica — and only small numbers of people are allowed on shore at one time.
Gentoo penguins are shown walking toward tourists in Antartica. (Danuta Hamlin/Fox News)
Penguins are everywhere, and they are fascinating. They are birds that do not fly but are expert swimmers.
The Antarctic Ocean is the source of their food supply, but also their biggest adversary ... not because of the low temperature of the water but because of the ever-present leopard seal predators.
Penguins gather in groups and dive in large numbers to diminish the odds of being eaten.

Oddly enough, they have very short legs, even though they live in a habitat with snow piling up high around them.
To manage, penguins move along the same paths, known as penguin highways, walking up and down or sliding on their bellies, while gathering pebbles to reinforce their nests.
All tourists are required to stay clear of these highways and not allowed to disrupt penguin habitats.
Zodiac boats are shown heading for the frozen land; in the foreground, penguins. (Danuta Hamlin/Fox News)
Antarctica can be quite cold even during the summer, while the winter is incredibly harsh. The life of a penguin can be shockingly difficult.
The one good thing about their habitat is the absence of polar bears, which are found only in the Arctic on the other side of the globe.
ANTARCTICA'S ‘DOOMSDAY GLACIER’ IS MELTING AWAY DIFFERENTLY THAN SCIENTISTS FIRST THOUGHT
I asked one of our expedition guides why the similar Arctic climate in the north wasn’t home to any penguins.
He replied that efforts had been made in the past to resettle penguins to the Arctic, but it did not end well for them, as they wound up being eaten by the polar bears.

Although the penguins are almost too adorable for one to stop observing them, one cannot forget about the seals and the whales.
Poached almost to extinction in the past, they thrive now and entertain tourists with their fancy dives and waterspouts.

Cruising in the Antarctic Peninsula offers some truly breathtaking views — but can be tricky.
The intended destination can change at any time due to ice and weather conditions.

One morning, while enjoying a sip of coffee on the deck, I noticed that our ship turned around suddenly and began sailing in the opposite direction.
In a voice bordering on desperation, our cruise director announced that she had no idea whatsoever where we were going — and was giving up on announcing any future landings.

Little did we know what our captain had in store for us that day.

Snow was falling and ice shields covered the water near our original destination — the old British Antarctic base, which is now a tiny museum.
The captain halted the ship next to a pile of rocks.

He then informed us that from there, we only had about half an hour walk to the base.

When our turn came, we were told to follow in the footsteps of those who went before us.
Well, following footsteps left in very deep snow turned out to be quite difficult.
If we were in Norway or Alaska, perhaps there would be a rental shop with snowshoes or cross-country skis — but in Antarctica nature rules.
It became obvious that we were sailing into a dense soup of freshly broken ice sheet.
It was the hardest walk of my life, trying to stay on the icy surface, but frequently sinking deep in snow.
We all made our way to the British base and back ...  with our clothing soaked through from perspiration.

Aboard the vessel, we were able to relax and enjoy the spectacular views without much physical effort. We saw small pieces of broken ice begin to appear, with penguins drifting on some, seals resting on others.
It was fun for a while, until it became obvious that we were sailing into a dense soup of freshly broken ice sheet.

Passengers began to spill out onto the decks, looking concerned, wondering if there was a chance we could get stuck.
But as they stared ahead, the ice was only getting denser … and this time we did not turn around.

Our captain was not a quitter. He crunched through the ice the entire night. We were banging into pieces of ice and the vessel was screeching as if it were on its last leg.
By the morning, we were out of the ice passage.
We asked the captain how often a ship like this actually sinks, but before he could answer one of the passengers piped up, ""Usually only once.""

Brilliant sun came out.
And we spent a lovely day at a Chilean base on the mainland, getting our passports stamped and doing some penguin watching.
But the Antarctic excitement wasn’t over yet, as soon enough, we found ourselves sailing through Iceberg Alley.
Beautifully situated Chilean base on the Antarctic mainland.  (Danuta Hamlin/Fox News)
We had a second captain on board just to navigate the icebergs, so we felt confident that we were in good hands.
It was an incredible, almost eerie, sight — rows of floating iceberg of humongous proportions, as far as the eye could see.
I spotted penguins traveling on one of them, but for the most part they were just empty blocks of ice, drifting aimlessly.

The surprising thing is that icebergs are not made of frozen saltwater. They are freshwater layers of compressed snow and could serve as a good source of drinkable water if defrosted and properly filtered.

Antarctica is the world’s largest desert — and the coldest, windiest and least colorful continent, veiled in almost absolute silence.
It’s been set aside and protected as a scientific preserve by the Antarctic treaty, now signed by 56 countries.
It’s a very special place where the overwhelming beauty of the landscape makes visitors want to forget about its dangers.

"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/washington-pastor-acknowledges-pain-putdowns-against-christian-faith-ask-god-courage","Washington pastor acknowledges the pain of putdowns against the Christian faith: 'Ask God for courage'","Pastor Jesse Bradley joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to spread a message of love and faith ahead of the September 11th.
How should you respond today when someone opposes and puts down your faith?
This can be all too familiar experience for many people in 2023, no matter their particular faith, denomination, practice or belief — and a Washington pastor who runs a Christian church weighed in with thoughts about this unfortunate but all too real circumstance.
""It can be painful when someone verbally attacks you because of your faith,"" said Pastor Jesse Bradley of Auburn, Washington, who runs Grace Community Church outside Seattle.
FAITH DILEMMA IN FOCUS: 'IT'S SUNDAY AND I HAVEN'T GONE TO CHURCH — WHAT DO I DO?'
""Your beliefs can be a magnet for people who want to undermine or obliterate your relationship with God and worldview,"" he said.
He also noted, ""Religious persecution is global and can result in jail, beatings — even death. More often, though, the experiences are slander, exclusion, mocking, canceling or bullying.""
""More often,"" people experience religious persecution, said one pastor, through ""slander, exclusion, mocking, canceling or bullying."" (iStock)
Bradley noted that while people ""can't stop the negativity"" of others — they can selectively ""choose their reaction.""
He shared three key insights and tips in comments to Fox News Digital on the topic.
""When your faith is not a blind faith, but is based on historical facts, you are on solid ground,"" said the pastor.
""Facts lead to faith. Christianity, for example, is based on the resurrection of Jesus and the clear evidence is very compelling. Jesus is the truth (John 14:6) — and there is no deception with Him.""
THE LORD IS ‘THE ORIENTING CENTER OF OUR LIVES,’ SAYS MASSACHUSETTS FAITH LEADER: ‘WE CAN BE BOLD’
He added, ""God is faithful and keeps all of His promises. In Matthew 5: 11-12, Jesus reminds His followers that they are blessed when people persecute them because the rewards in heaven will be immense.""
Said Pastor Jesse Bradley of Auburn, Washington, ""Love includes prayer. Love includes sacrifice. Love includes forgiveness."" Yes ""forgiveness does not mean that you will be close friends. Distance may be wise"" in certain cases, he noted.  (Pastor Jesse Bradley/iStock)
Bradley pointed out, ""Make sure that you are not looking down on people, being rude and hypocritical — or misinterpreting what someone is communicating. Those are not forms of persecution, but personal changes you need to make.""
Bradley detailed some of the teachings of the New Testament that many Christians know well.
""When Jesus was beaten, mocked, spit upon and murdered, He continued to love the people who hurt Him. He prayed for them, asking God to forgive them because they, in a very deep sense, did not know what they were doing.""
""Because Jesus has forgiven your sins, you need to forgive everyone fully.""
Said Bradley, ""Love includes prayer. Love includes sacrifice. Love includes forgiveness. Forgiveness does not mean that you will be close friends. Distance may be wise.""

Forgiveness, however, ""means that you will not harbor bitterness, resentment or try to get revenge.""
""When Jesus was beaten, mocked, spit upon and murdered, He continued to love the people who hurt Him. He prayed for them, asking God to forgive them because they, in a very deep sense, did not know what they were doing,"" said the pastor. (iStock)

And ""because Jesus has forgiven your sins, you need to forgive everyone fully. Love and forgiveness glorify God and free you from the burden and poison of unforgiveness.""
When Jesus was persecuted, ""He did not shrink back, give into fear, quit His mission, become silent, water down the message — or deny the reality of the experience,"" said Pastor Bradley.
""Avoid temptations of crowd approval and looking for the easiest road all the time.""
He urged those of the Christian faith to ""be like Jesus"" in this regard.
""Avoid temptations of crowd approval and looking for the easiest road all the time. Make faithfulness to God your top priority — and trust him with the results.""

The pastor, husband and father also pointed out, ""Many people put their faith on the back burner when opposition increases. Instead, ask God for courage and meditate on His word (Joshua 1:6-9). Continue to love God with all your heart, love your neighbor and share your faith.""

He also said, ""God is with you always and will never leave you or forsake you. Nothing can separate you from the love of Christ (Romans 8:38-39).""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Newlyweds who had gotten married two weeks before traveled a total of 360 miles to recreate their wedding ceremony for a second time — so that the bride’s grandmother could attend the big day.
Childhood sweethearts Will and Rebecca Heppell, both 26, tied the knot in front of 60 guests in a picturesque ceremony in the Cotswolds last month, as SWNS, the British news service, reported.
The pair then re-enacted their vows in a more intimate setting exactly two weeks later in the grounds of the care home where Rebecca Heppell's grandmother, Peggy Dracup, is currently living.

The grandmother is 91 and reportedly has Alzheimer’s. She wasn't able to attend the first ceremony, said SWNS — so the couple repeated the ceremony 164 miles away in order to make her part of their big day.
Said Rebecca Heppell, ""It was a really special day and [it was] great that my grandma could be part of it. She was overjoyed.""

She added, ""Her memory isn’t great, but she knew who we were … and she kept saying how beautiful my dress was.""
The newlyweds are both teachers.
They met as teenagers and got engaged on a romantic break in Iceland on their 10th anniversary last March, said SWNS.
The couple's first wedding took place on August 5; after their honeymoon, they returned home to recreate the special day on August 29.
When it came time to plan their big day, the couple wanted to make sure their grandmother could be a part of it.

But the staff at Osborne House in Selby, North Yorkshire, where Peggy Dracup is living, felt she wouldn’t be up the long journey to the Cotswolds venue.
Undeterred, the couple arranged to recreate the whole day in the grounds of the care home with their grandmother in attendance.
The couple's first wedding took place on August 5; they honeymooned in Kenya and Mauritius, returning home to recreate the special day on August 29, SWNS reported.
The second ceremony was an exact replica of the first — with the second ceremony even decorated the very same way.

The couple apparently went into ""minute detail"" to recreate their special day, right down to striking the same pose during their first dances.
Afterward, the couple were showered with hundreds of rose petals as a very proud grandmother enjoyed the moments.
Said bride Rebecca Heppell, who is from Chipping Norton, ""I really wanted her to be there. We were hoping she’d be able to come down, but the practicality of her coming down to the Cotswolds just wasn’t going to happen. But it was great. She didn’t know it wasn’t the real ceremony — she loved it.""
""And we weren’t as nervous the second time round. It was much more relaxed.""
The bride added, ""And we weren’t as nervous the second time round. It was much more relaxed.""
She also said her grandmother loves music, so her sister played ""a few tunes"" at the ceremony.

The bride said the people at ""the care home were absolutely amazing. The events manager went above and beyond and created a magical setting and made a spectacular wedding cake adorned with handmade sugar roses.""
Groom Will Heppell told SWNS, ""It was doubly magical, because we were reliving the original ceremony.""

Said mother of the bride Helen Harrison, ""It was hugely important for Rebecca that her grandmother should be present to be part of the celebration and it was wonderful day. My daughter looked fabulous and her grandmother commented on the beauty of her dress.""
Harrison added, ""It was delightful to see my mom interacting with so many people, smiling and laughing and having all her family around her.""

""Osborne House was beautifully decorated,"" added Harrison, ""and the chef went above and beyond anyone’s expectation catering for the reception with a spectacular silver service buffet tea — a grand finale to a perfect day.""
